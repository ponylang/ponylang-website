Thanks to Gordon Tisher for finding the cause of our extreme busy wait problem on Windows and issuing a fix for it. We consider that a high priority issue which means, release away. Since it's only been a day since our last release, not a lot else in this one.

Windows, Debian and RedHat packages are available via Bintray. OSX via Homebrew should be coming soon.
