Prior to [PR #1794](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1794), `ponyc` would only look for a linker from the version of Visual Studio with which it was compiled, and only looked at one registry key for install information. A recent change ([44b2d56](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/commit/44b2d56c5618142fe0fd628eeadbd5975157d62f)) broke support for Visual Build Tools C++ 2015. 

## [0.12.3] - 2017-04-01

### Fixed

- Improve Visual Studio and Microsoft C++ Build Tools detection. (PR #1794)
