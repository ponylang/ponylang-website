Pony 0.15.0 closes some high priority bugs across all platforms. Upgrading as soon as possible is highly recommended. Please note, this release contains breaking changes and might require code updates on your part.

## Highlights

There's a lot to highlight in the 0.15.0 release:

## Exhaustive match

It's one of the most requested features for Pony, and it's finally arrived. Previously the Pony compiler didn't do exhaustiveness checking for matches which meant you always had to have a `else None` clause. Depending on the situation, this ranged from mildly annoying to exceedingly aggravating. Now instead of having code like:

```pony
fun my_fun(a: (String | U64)) =>
  match a
  | let x: String => "something"
  | let y: U64 => "something else"
  else None
    "ugh this sucks"
  end
```

We have the much more pleasing:

```pony
fun my_fun(a: (String | U64)) =>
  match a
  | let x: String => "something"
  | let y: U64 => "something else"
  end
```

It should be noted that there is currently [an open bug related to exhaustive match](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/1975). If you start taking advantage of exhaustive match, be aware that you might be impacted. Expect a fix in the near future and a new release once that fix lands.

Thanks, Joe McIlvain for bringing this one home.

## Custom object serialization

Pony now includes support for custom serialization mechanisms. See [RFC #21](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0021-custom-serialization.md) for full details. Big thanks to Andrew Turley and the folks at Sendence for this enhancement to Pony serialization.

## C API callback support

You can now interoperate with C APIs that requires function callbacks thanks to the newly added ["bare lambdas"](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0034-bare-ffi-lambdas.md) feature. There are some C libraries that were impossible to work with before this change. We now have a much better C-FFI story to tell. Thanks go out to Benoit for implementing this RFC.

## New persistent collections types

Theo Butler added two new persistent collections types (Vector and Set) to the standard library. Thanks Theo for your work pushing the persistent collections classes forward.

## Time.wall_to_nanos is no more

If you were previously using `Time.wall_to_nanos` and you inspected the values you were getting from it; you might have noticed that they weren't particularly "sensible." One would expect the nanosecond value returned to be the number of nanoseconds since "the beginning of time." However, it wasn't. `Time.wall_to_nanos` has been removed from the standard library and replaced with `Nanos.from_wall_clock`. If you need to convert a wall clock time into a nanosecond timestamp since "the beginning of time," this is your function. Code that was previously:

```pony
use time

fun my_time_thing() =>
  Time.wall_to_nanos(Time.now())
```

should be updated to be:

 ```pony

use time

fun my_time_thing() =>
  Nanos.from_wall_clock(Time.now())
```

## Machine word constructors no longer have a default argument

Honestly, this breaking change shouldn't be a breaking change for anyone. If it is, you are doing something pretty special. This change fixes some issues with comparing machine words using the `is` keyword. Full details can be seen in the [PR](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1938).

## iftype syntax update

We recently introduced a new [`iftype` syntax](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1855). After it was released, we decided that the keywords introduced for it were less than optimal. With this change, the `elseiftype` keyword is removed and replaced with `elseif`. This is a breaking change but, given the newness of `iftype`, we doubt it impacts on anyone yet.
