Pony 0.17.0 is a recommended release if you are using GCC 7 on Linux. Before this release, GCC 7 was unable to build the Pony compiler. If you aren't using GCC 7, you can take your time upgrading. Please note, there is a breaking change in this release, but it's quite unlikely that anyone will be impacted by it.

## Treat `as` type of array literals as the alias of the element type

Previously, an array literal, even when the `as` type is given explicitly, uses the alias of the as type as the type argument for the Array type. For example:

```pony
trait iso T
class iso A is T
class iso B is T
class iso C is T

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    let a: T = A
    let b: T = B
    let c: T = C
    let abc: Array[T] = [as T^: A; B; C] // works
    let abc': Array[T] = [as T: A; B; C] // fails: literal has type Array[T!]
```

We doubt that anyone currently has the `// works`` line anywhere in their code. However, if you are impacted, update it to:

```pony
let abc': Array[T] = [as T: A; B; C]
```

## `default_pic` build option

Previously on platforms that required PIC, you would have to pass the `--pic` flag to `ponyc` each time you compiled a Pony program. With the addition of `default_pic`, you can build `ponyc` so that `--pic` is automatically handled for you. Use `make default_pic=true` when building `ponyc` and away you go!

### Fixed

- Fix cursor location for displaying compiler errors and info. ([PR #2136](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2136))
- Fix indent detection when lexing docstrings that contain whitespace-only lines. ([PR #2131](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2131))
- Fix compiler crash on typecheck error in FFI call. ([PR #2124](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2124))
- Fix compiler assert on match including structural equality on union type. ([PR #2117](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2117))

### Added

- Support GCC7 on Linux ([PR #2134](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2134))
- Add regex match iterator ([PR #2109](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2109))
- Add more promise methods (RFC 35) ([PR #2084](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2084))
- Add ability to default enable PIC when compiling ponyc ([PR #2113](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2113))

### Changed

- Treat `as` type of array literals as the alias of the element type. ([PR #2126](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2126))
- docgen: ignore test types and add cli flag to only document public types ([PR #2112](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2112))
