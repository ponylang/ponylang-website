Pony 0.18.0 contains a high priority compiler bug fix. We recommend updating as soon as possible. Note, however, that there is a small breaking change in this release as well. It should be a quick upgrade if you are impacted.

## Fix compiler crash on union-of-tuples to tuple conversions

Previously, when trying to compile a union-of-tuples, the compiler would segfault. Very annoying if you had a reasonable program like:

```pony
primitive Add
primitive Dec
type AddOrDec is (Add | Dec)
type CmRDTCounterOp is (AddOrDec, U128)

class CmRDTCounter
  var _value: U128

  new create() => _value = 0

  fun read(): U128 =>
    _value

  fun ref add(number: U128): CmRDTCounterOp =>
    let op: CmRDTCounterOp =
      if number >= 0 then
        (Add, number)
      else
        (Dec, number)
      end
    apply(op)
    op

  fun ref apply(op: CmRDTCounterOp) =>
    match op
      | (Add, let number: U128) => _value = _value + number
      | (Dec, let number: U128) => _value = _value - number
    end

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    var counter = CmRDTCounter.create()
    let op1 = counter.add(10)
```

If you are interested in learning more, we suggest checking out [issue #1513](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/1513) for a bit more background and listen to the [August 16, 2017, Pony development sync call](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2017_08_16.m4a) where we discussed it in depth.

## Change String.join to take Iterable

0.18.0 includes the implementation of [RFC #48](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0048-change-String-join-to-take-iterable.md). It's a nice improvement to the usability of `String.join`. It is also, sadly, a breaking change. Such is life. Sometimes you break things to improve them. Upgrading should be straightforward. 

Where you previously called `"_".join(["zomg"])`, you would now call `"_".join(["zomg"].values())`. Any place you hit a compiler error related to `String.join`, add a `.values()` to the `ReadSeq` you are passing and everything will work. 

### Fixed

- Fix compiler crash on union-of-tuples to tuple conversions ([PR #2176](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2176))
- Fix compiler error on lambda capture of '_' ([PR #2171](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2171))
- Fix read past the end of a buffer in `pool.c`. ([PR #2139](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2139))

### Changed

- Make actor continuations a build time option ([PR #2179](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2179))
- RFC #48 Change String.join to take Iterable ([PR #2159](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2159))
- Change fallback linker to "gcc" from "gcc-6" on Linux. ([PR #2166](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2166))
- Change the signature of `pony_continuation` and `pony_triggergc` to take a `pony_ctx_t*` instead of a `pony_actor_t*`.
