Pony 0.18.1 contains a high priority bug fix in the ProcessMonitor package. We recommend upgrading as soon as possible. There are no breaking changes in this release.
<!--more-->

## Process monitor async write buffering 

Before this release, it was easy to swamp an external process started by the `ProcessMonitor` with too many writes.  Excessive writes would result in errors and lost data. 0.18.1 adds write buffering thereby avoiding lost data.

## DragonFly BSD 4.8 support

Pony has been ported to support DragonFly BSD 4.8. Note, we do not have CI for DragonFly, so support is provided on a "best-effort" basis. That is, we won't intentionally break support, but we also aren't actively testing commits against DragonFly so some breakage can be expected.

### Fixed

- Don't print capabilities for type params when generating docs ([PR #2184](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2184))

### Added

- DragonFly BSD 4.8 support ([PR #2183](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2183))
- Process monitor async write buffering ([PR #2186](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2186))
