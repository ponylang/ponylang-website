Pony 0.19.0 contains breaking changes. If you don't use the `Itertools` package then upgrading should be painless. If you do use `Itertools`, the process should be relatively straightforward. MacOS, FreeBSD and Dragonfly BSD users are recommended to upgrade as soon as possible to fix a race condition on the kqueue event system.

## Improve the `Itertools` API

The implementation of [RFC #49](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0049-improved-itertools-api.md) makes many changes to the itertools package. The first significant change is that all classes other than `Iter` have been removed. All of these classes have had equivalent functions in the `Iter` class, the exception being `Repeat`, which is now handled by the `repeat_value` constructor. So, for example, `Repeat[String]("a")` should be replaced by `Iter[String].repeat_value("a")`.

Another significant change is that `fold` has become non-partial and has had its arguments switched so that the lambda is placed last. For example:

```pony
let sum =
  try  
    Iter[I64]([1; 2; 3].values())
      .fold[I64]({(sum: I64, n: I64): I64 => sum + n }, 0)?
  else
    I64(0)
  end
```

Should be replaced by

```pony
let sum =
  Iter[I64]([1; 2; 3].values())
    .fold[I64](0, {(sum: I64, n: I64): I64 => sum + n })
```

If the lambda argument to `fold` needs to be partial, then you should use the new `fold_partial` method.

Other methods have been added to the `Iter` class such as `flat_map`, `filter_map`, as well as methods that allow lambdas with `ref` receivers for stateful transformations. These methods have a "_stateful" suffix, such as `map_stateful` and `filter_stateful`.

## Fix signals on Sierra

MacOS Sierra changed how signals are delivered to multithreaded processes. Pony's signal handling has been broken on Sierra since it was introduced. It's now fixed as Sylvan and Sean finally sat down to figure out what was going on.

### Fixed

- Fix codegen failures on incompatible FFI declarations ([PR #2205](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2205))
- Disallow named arguments for methods of a type union where parameter names differ ([PR #2194](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2194))
- Fix compiler crash on illegal read from '_' ([PR #2201](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2201))
- Fix signals on Sierra ([PR #2195](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2195))
- Fix race condition in kqueue event system implementation ([PR #2193](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2193))

### Added

- `pony_chain` runtime function

### Changed

- The `pony_sendv` and `pony_sendv_single` runtime functions now take a message chain instead of a single message
- Improve the itertools API (RFC 49) ([PR #2190](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2190))
- Forbid struct finalisers ([PR #2202](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2202))
