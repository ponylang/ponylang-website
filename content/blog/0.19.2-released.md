Pony 0.19.2 features a high priority fix for a bug in Pony serialization. Before 0.19.2, serialising an empty string would cause a segmentation fault.

## Fix empty string serialisation

The Pony 0.15.0 release introduced a bug in Pony serialization. From Pony 0.15.0 to 0.19.1 the following code would cause a segfault:

```pony
use "serialise"

actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    try
      let auth = env.root as AmbientAuth
      Serialised(SerialiseAuth(auth), "")?
    end
```

## RFC #46 implemented

Pony 0.19.2 also includes the implementation of [RFC #46: More random methods](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0046-more-random-methods.md).
The following methods were added to the `Random` trait, similar to the existing `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, and `u128` methods:

```pony
  fun ref ulong(): ULong =>
    """
    A random integer in [0, ULong.max_value()]
    """

  fun ref usize(): USize =>
    """
    A random integer in [0, USize.max_value()]
    """

  fun ref i8(): I8 =>
    """
    A random integer in [-2^8, 2^8)
    """

  fun ref i16(): I16 =>
    """
    A random integer in [-2^16, 2^16)
    """

  fun ref i32(): I32 =>
    """
    A random integer in [-2^32, 2^32)
    """

  fun ref i64(): I64 =>
    """
    A random integer in [-2^64, 2^64)
    """

  fun ref i128(): I128 =>
    """
    A random integer in [-2^128, 2^128)
    """

  fun ref ilong(): ILong =>
    """
    A random integer in [ILong.min_value(), ILong.max_value()]
    """

  fun ref isize(): ISize =>
    """
    A random integer in [ISize.min_value(), ISize.max_value()]
    """
```

Additionally, the existing `int` method of the `Random` trait was updated to allow specifying the integer type as a type parameter, instead of only supporting the `U64` type:

```pony
  fun ref int[N: (Unsigned val & Real[N] val) = U64](n: N): N =>
    """
    A random integer in [0, n)
    """
```

The array-oriented `shuffle` method was added to the `Random` trait.

```pony
  fun ref shuffle[A](array: Array[A]) =>
    """
    Shuffle the elements of the array into a random order, mutating the array.
    """
```

To support `Random.shuffle`, the `swap_elements` was added to the `Array` class (because otherwise, it is not possible to swap two elements in place without aliasing them):

```pony
  fun ref swap_elements(i: USize, j: USize) ? =>
    """
    Swap the element at index i with the element at index j.
    If either i or j are out of bounds, an error is raised.
    """
```

### Fixed

- Fix codegen failure on field access ([PR #2244](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2244))
- Make Windows link step use the command-line `--linker` value if present. ([PR #2231](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2231))
- Fix empty string serialisation ([PR #2247](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2247))

### Added

- Added Array.swap_elements, Random.shuffle and extends Random with methods for generating all Integer types (RFC 46). ([PR #2128](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2128))
