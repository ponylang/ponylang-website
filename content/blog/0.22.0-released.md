Pony 0.22.0 is a recommended update. It's a large update as we ended up not releasing on our normal monthly schedule. There are some stability fixes as well as a variety of other changes. This release includes breaking changes and will probably require you to update your code.

Please note, due to some issues when releasing, we will be doing 0.22.1 release in the next day that will have no changes. It's solely to get an official  Docker image built for this release.

## Make digestof and hash() return USize instead of U64 and add hash64()

The `Hashable` interface now requires objects to provide a `hash()` function returning `USize` instead of `U64`. If some of your types provide `hash(),` you should change the return type and modify the implementation accordingly. A `Hashable64` interface requiring a `hash64()` function returning `U64` is now available.

## Forbid impossible pattern matching on generic capabilities 

Pattern matching on generic capabilities is now prohibited. This means that code like the following example won't compile anymore.

```pony
fun foo[A: Any #send](a: A) =>
  match a
  | let a': Any val => print("val")
  else
    print("other")
  end
```

`iftype` should be used as a replacement.

```pony
fun foo[A: Any #send](a: A) =>
  iftype A <: Any val then
    print("val")
  else
    print("other")
  end
```

## New Ponybench API

The `ponybench` micro-benchmarking framework has changed to have more flexible configuration and produce more detailed statistics. The API now resembles that of the `ponytest` package and has a greater distinction between synchronous and asynchronous benchmarks. The new framework now provides the option to output CSV with the `-csv` flag. The CSV output may be used to create box plots, histograms, and other visual representations of the benchmark data. Details of how to use the new API are available in the [package documentation](https://stdlib.ponylang.io/ponybench--index).

## Expose OutStream rather than StdStream in Env

Previously `Env.out` and `Env.err` were of the type `StdStream.` This worked fine but didn't make for easy testing of output. `Env.out` and `Env.err` are now of type `OutStream` which is an interface rather than a concrete type. By making Env expose and rely on the OutStream interface, it is possible to create mock environments for testing. For example, one can
implement an OutStreamStringAccumulator that accumulates output to a String that can then be checked in a unit test. Updating your code is straightforward. Change `StdStream` to `OutStream` for anything where you got the `StdStream` from `Env.`

## Allow more customization of artificial environments

In the same realm of "Expose OutStream rather than StdStream in Env," we made artificial `Env` instances even more customizable, which are mostly used for testing. It is now possible to "mock" both `Env.input` representing stdin and intercept setting the exit code via `Env.exitcode.`

`Env.input` used to be of type `Stdin` which didn't allow easy mocking, now it is the interface `InputStream` which is easily implemented for testing. `Stdin`used to require a `StdinNotify` to receive stdin data to the application. In order to stay consistent with the new `InputStream` `StdinNotify` has been renamed to `InputNotify`.

## Rename Date to PosixDate

The`Date` class has been renamed to `PosixDate` to better reflect that it is not a full grown date class that handles all corner cases, timezones, calendars. It is implemented after the POSIX tm struct. Its API stayed the same with the exception that now if provided with negative constructor parameters it will coalesce them to `0` to avoid creating invalid dates by accident.

## Add SourceLoc.type_name method, showing the name of the containing type

The `SourceLoc` interface is used for representing a location in Pony source code, filled in automatically by the compiler when using the `__loc` keyword. A `type_name` function has been added to this interface, and the `method` function has been renamed as `method_name` for consistency. Any Pony code that was using `SourceLoc` and/or `__loc` objects to print the name of a method will need to be updated with this name change. They will also now have the `type_name` available to print if they so choose.
