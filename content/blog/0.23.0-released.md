Pony 0.23.0 is primarily a bug fix release but does also include some additional changes. Upgrading is recommended. There is a single breaking change caused by the implementation of [RFC 56](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0056-buffered-reader-line-iso.md).

## RFC 56: Make buffered.reader.line return String iso^

`buffered.Reader.line()` has been changed to return a `String iso^` instead of a `String val`. This is more powerful as it allows you to mutate the lines returned in place, which was impossible with `String val`. Nonetheless this is a breaking change. It will break code that relies on type inference, avoiding stating the type for the variable the line is assigned to:

```pony
let line = reader.line()?
process_line(line)
```

These code bases need to adapt in one of two ways:
* mark the `line` variable explicitly as `String val`:

   ```pony
   let line: String val = reader.line()?
   process_line(line)
   ```
* `consume` the variable upon usage, as it is `iso` now:

   ```pony
   let line = reader.line()?
   process_line(consume line)
   ```

### Fixed

- Fix File.writev and File.flush in cases where the IO vector exceeds IOV_MAX. ([PR #2771](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2771))
- Fix incorrect tuple handling ([PR #2763](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2763))
- Fix Promise bug where join() element's reject doesn't reject the entire join ([PR #2770](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2770))

### Added

- Add Integer.bit_reverse, exposing the llvm.bitreverse intrinsic. ([PR #2710](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2710))

### Changed

- RFC 56: Make buffered.reader.line return String iso^ ([PR #2756](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2756))
