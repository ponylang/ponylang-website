Pony 0.24.0 includes high-priority bug fixes. Updating as soon as possible is recommended. The release also contains breaking changes, please refer to the release notes for more details.

<!--more-->
## Remove HTTP libraries from the Pony standard library

The `net/http` package has been removed from the stdlib, with it the `HTTPClient`, `HTTPServer` and `URL` classes. They now live in the [http](https://github.com/ponylang/http) package and can be included using [stable](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable) by adding them to your `bundle.json` like so: 

```bash
stable add github ponylang/http --tag 0.1.0
```

The code in the new repository at version `0.1.0` is exactly the same as it was when it was removed from stdlib. Thus the only change you need to do is to change your imports from `use "net/http"` to `use "http"`.

## Change refcap of JsonDoc for better usability

The `json` package got rid of some inconveniences you could encounter when using `JsonDoc` to parse JSON and access the parsed representation. This was due to the constructor of `JsonDoc` returning instances with an `iso` reference capability and having the actual JSON `data` inside being `ref` (in some cases). For ensuring safety the compiler does not allow to access `ref` fields from an `iso` reference (they are being seen as `tag`). This could have led to confusing error messages. 

This is all gone now, `JsonDoc` will be created with a `ref` reference capability. That means it is not sendable by default anymore, but now much much more usable:

```pony
use "json"
actor Main
  new create(env: Env) =>
    try
      let doc = JsonDoc
      doc.parse("""{"array": [1, "str", true]}""")
      let obj = doc.data as JsonObject
    end
```

## Change NetAddress class to hide its fields behind functions, fixing cross-platform compatibility

`net.NetAddress` has been modelled after the C union `sockaddr_storage` which happens to have different fields on different platforms (i.e. on linux a 16 bit family field and on e.g. OSX an 8 bit length field an only a 8 bit family field). This PR unifies `net.NetAddress` to return consistent values on any platform Pony is supported on. To this end, all previously public fields on this class have been made private and new functions have been introduced to return those values:

* **Removed Field** | **New Method**
* `length: U8` | `length(): U8`
* `family: U8` | `family(): U8`
* `port: U16` | `port(): U16`
* `addr: U32` | `ipv4_addr(): U32`
* `addr1, addr2, addr3, addr4` | `ipv6_addr(): (U32, U32, U32, U32)`
* `scope: U32` | `scope(): U32`

All functions return the values in host byte order, that means conversion using `@ntohX` FFI functions is not necessary anymore. Before calling and using `ipv4_addr()` or `ipv6_addr()` check `ip4(): Bool` and `ip6(): Bool` which one to use, otherwise the returned values will be invalid (as before using the fields).
