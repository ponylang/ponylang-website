Pony 0.28.1 is here! It includes a couple high-priority bug fixes. Updating as soon as possible is recommended. Please note, the [Homebrew PR](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/40581) hasn't yet been merged so you can't update using Homebrew until that is done. All other supported platforms are good to go!

## Fix cycle detector issue with checking for blocked actors 

Fix issue #2975 where the cycle detector wasn't correctly reaping cycles of dead actors. Change cycle detector to use the maximum of `1000` or 10% of all actors currently alive for how many actors to query when the cycle detector periodically checks to see which actors are currently blocked. This is based on a suggestion by @plprofetes to ensure that the cycle detector is effective even for applications with a large number (millions) of temporary actors.

## Add unchop to array and unchop, repeat_str and mul to string

* Adds `unchop` to both array and string to allow the the original string or array to be recovered by combining the two pieces from a previous `chop`.
* Adds `repeat_str` and `mul` to string to allow easy repeating of strings (such as `'abc' * 6` to get `abcabcabcabcabcabc` or `'abc'.repeat_str(6, ', ')` to get `abc, abc, abc, abc, abc, abc`)

## Several Improvements to the random package

* Add XorOshiro128** and SplitMix64 PRNGs http://xoshiro.di.unimi.it/
* Update XorOshiro128+ paramaters as noted in http://xoshiro.di.unimi.it/xoroshiro128plus.c
* Add `from_64bits` constructor to 128 bit state PRNGs that uses SplitMix64 as suggested here: http://xoshiro.di.unimi.it/
* Use fixed-point inversion for generating bounded random numbers using `Random.int`. But fall back to slower floating-point multiplication technique if no native 128 bit ops are supported.
* Add `Random.int_unbiased` function for generating an unbiased bounded random number. For details see: http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/bounded-rands.html This one is slightly slower as `Random.int`.
* Added tests and benchmarks

## Don't turn off Epoll OneShot when resubscribing to OneShot events 

Fixes the performance regression introduced in https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2897

### Fixed

- Don't turn off Epoll OneShot when resubscribing to events  ([PR #3136](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3136))
- Add unchop to array and unchop, repeat_str and mul to string ([PR #3155](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3155))
- Fix cycle detector issue with checking for blocked actors ([PR #3154](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3154))
- Wake up suspended scheduler threads if there is work for another one ([PR #3153](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3153))

### Added

- Add Docker image based on Alpine ([PR #3138](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3135))
- Added `XorOshiro128StarStar` and `SplitMix64` PRNGs. ([PR #3135](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3135))
- Added function `Random.int_unbiased`. ([PR #3135](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3135))
- Added `from_u64` constructor to 128 bit state PRNGs. ([PR #3135](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3135))
- Add unchop to array and unchop, repeat_str and mul to string ([PR #3155](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3155))

### Changed

- Updated `XorOshiro128Plus` parameters. This PRNG will now produce different values for the same seed as before. ([PR #3135](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3135))
- Use fixed-point inversion for `Random.int` if the platform allows. ([PR #3135](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3135))
