Pony version 0.31.0 is now available. This is a "smaller" release than some recent ones. Most of the changes in Pony lately have been happening behind the scenes.


0.31.0 is a breaking release. There's a small change to `Map.sub` that might break your code. Details follow. There are no serious bugs fixed in 0.31.0 so you can upgrade at your leisure.
<!--more-->
## Remove unnecessary argument to `Map.sub`

Before:
```pony
let m: Map[String, U32] = Map[String, U32]
m.insert("one", 1)
m.insert("two", 2)
let m2 = m - ("two", 3132047) // removes ("two", 2) from the Map
```

After:
```pony
let m: Map[String, U32] = Map[String, U32]
m.insert("one", 1)
m.insert("two", 2)
let m2 = m - "two"
```

## Add `proxy_via(host: String, service: String): (String, String)` to `TCPConnectionNotify`

This function is called before the initial TCP connection is made, allowing the `TCPConnectionNotify` to alter the target of the connection. This enables a `TCPConnectionNotify` implementation to handle the proxy handshake and redirect traffic via that proxy.

It is optional to implement, with the default changing nothing.

It is recommended that TCP client creators add a parameter to their constructors, with the default of `NoProxy` and to wrap their `TCPConnectionNotify` which enables users to use proxies.
```pony
actor MyClient
  new create(env: Env, host: String, service: String, proxy: Proxy = NoProxy) ? =>
    TCPConnection = TCPConnection.create(
        env.root as AmbientAuth,
        proxy.apply(MyConnectionNotify.create()),
        host,
        service)
```

### Fixed

- Fix static linking issue by changing the link order ([PR #3259](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3259))

### Added

- Add `--link-ldcmd` command line argument for overriding the `ld` command used for linking ([PR #3259](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3259))
- Make builds with `musl` on `glibc` systems possible ([PR #3263](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3263))
- Add `proxy_via(destination_host, destination_service)` to `TCPConnectionNotify` to allow TCP handlers to change the hostname & service from a TCPConnectionNotify before connecting ([PR #3230](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3230))
- Add `add` and `sub` to `collections/persistent/Map` ([PR #3275](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3275))
