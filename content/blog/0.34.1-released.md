What's new in 0.34.1?

Well, if you aren't using a glibc based Linux distribution, nothing! So, move along. Nothing for you to see here.

If you are using a glibc based Linux distribution, make sure you are using 0.34.1 and not 0.34.0.

## [0.34.1] - 2020-05-07

### Fixed

- Fix unneeded dependency on Linux glibc systems ([PR #3538](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3538))
