## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_01_03.m4a) from the January 3rd, 2023 sync is available.

<< content >>

If you are interested in attending a Pony Development Sync, please do! We have it on Zoom specifically because Zoom is the friendliest platform that allows folks without an explicit invitation to join. Every week, [a development sync reminder](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce/topic/Sync.20Reminder) with full information about the sync is posted to the [announce stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce) on the Ponylang Zulip. You can stay up-to-date with the sync schedule by subscribing to the [sync calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/59jcru6f50mrpqbm7em4iclnkk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). We do our best to keep the calendar correctly updated.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

Interested in giving attending Office Hours sometime? There's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Highlighted Issues

Pony is a volunteer driven project. Nothing gets down without someone volunteering their time and helping to push things forward. Yes, there are folks who dedicate more time than others and a core team that dedicates time specifically for guiding Pony's development. Everyone's time is limited, so each week, we highlight a couple of issues that we hope will inspire someone to volunteer their time to help fix.

In addition to our highlighted issues, you can find more that we are looking for assistance on by visiting just about any [repository in the ponylang org](https://github.com/ponylang/) and looking for issues labeled with "help wanted"

If you are interested in working on either issue or any other issue from a Ponylang repository, you can get in touch on the issue in question or, even better, join us on the [Ponylang Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/) to strike up a conversation.

This week's issues as selected by Ryan A. Hagenson are:
