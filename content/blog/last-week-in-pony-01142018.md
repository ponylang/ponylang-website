## Items of note

- The [Pony library starter pack](https://github.com/ponylang/library-project-starter) has gotten an update.
  
  Now includes CircleCI instead of TravisCI for default CI setup. The CircleCI configuration involves fewer manual setup steps so we decided to move to it for the default.

## Pony Development Sync

Another Sync call happened! Check out the [recorded audio](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/2018_01_10).

The next one is scheduled for Wednesday, January 17, 2018 at 03:30 PM (GMT-05:00) America/New York via zoom. Join the [Dev Mailing List](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev) to get all the details. We'd love to have you there.
