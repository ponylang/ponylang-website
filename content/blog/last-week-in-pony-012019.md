## Items of note

- Audio for the January 15, 2019 Pony sync is [here](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/2019_01_15/pony_sync_january_15_2019.m4a).


We now have a public Zulip community. The Zulip community originally started as a way for Sean and Sylvan to chat and eventually got expanded out to being for core team members and committers. We've decided to open it to the public. Interested in joining us? You can get an invite at: https://ponylang.zulipchat.com.


We've recently set up forwarding for email addresses at ponylang.io. If you are a Pony committer, we'd like to offer you a ponylang.io email address. The addresses are for use when conducting "official Pony business". These might eventually become a full blown email address; for now they just forward. The offer is open to anyone who has merge access on any of the official Pony projects. If you would like a ponylang.io email address, please email sean.allen@ponylang.io with your first name, last name and the email address you want the mail forwarded to.
