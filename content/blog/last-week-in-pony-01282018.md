## Items of note

- James Bracey wrote to the [user list](https://pony.groups.io/g/user) to let us all know about a [Pony Cassandra client](https://github.com/waratuman/pony-cql) he started. It's in early stages and it doesn't sound like he's planning on doing more work at this time, but he wanted to let folks know.
