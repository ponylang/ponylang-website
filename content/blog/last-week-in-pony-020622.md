It was a busy week in Pony. Pony 0.47.0 was released including a breaking change "Don't allow interfaces to have private methods". The change resulted in a number of library needed releases to work after the change.

It was also a busy week with RFCS. 3 new RFCs were opened, 1 was implemented, and [another](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/pull/193) has had continued discussion.

## Items of note

- Sean T. Allen held his second weekly "office hours" meeting.
