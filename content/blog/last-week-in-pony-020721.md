## The great default branch renaming

A while ago, GitHub switched the default branch for newly created repos to be `main`. To keep all our repos in-sync and to work more easily with tools in the future, we've been preparing to switch our existing repositories to having the default branch be `main`.

The renaming will start this week. It will be a slow roll-out. If you visit a repo after its branch has been changed, you will be prompted with a notice on what you need to do to adapt.

```bash
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
```

Should pretty much be what you have to do. We'll be announcing the changed repos as they happen in the [administrative stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/200978-administrative) on Zulip and also in upcoming issues of Last Week in Pony.
