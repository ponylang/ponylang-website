## Items of note

- Audio for the February 12, 2019 Pony sync is [here](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2019_02_12.m4a).

- Interested in helping improve the Pony emacs mode? There's a few ["help wanted" issues open](https://github.com/SeanTAllen/ponylang-mode/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) if you want to dive in.

- LLVM 7.0 support has been [merged to master](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2976). Great work by Joe and Gordon. Everyone should give them a virtual hand.

    Currently, LLVM 3.9.1 is still the recommended LLVM version to use with Pony. LLVM 5 and 6 both had work arounds for bugs and as such were "experimentally supported". However, LLVM 3.9.1 is being deprecated by a lot of distributions. Joe believes he has found the source of the LLVM 5 and 6 issues (which also impact on LLVM 7) and will be testing out a fix soon.


    If that fix appears to work, our plan is as follows:
    * Get some folks to start using LLVM 7.
    * If no one reports any issues with LLVM 7 after some undetermined period of time, make it the recommended default
    * Drop LLVM 3.9.1 support as we only support 3 major LLVM versions at a time.


    If you'd be willing to give LLVM 7 a try, [drop @SeanTAllen a line](mailto:sean@monkeysnatchbanana.com) and he'll let you know when we are ready for testing.
