## Items of Note

Not much happened this week, no progress on RFCs, not even a Pony Development Sync took place. So this nearly would have been a rather sad post. 

But hey, let's all take the time to watch the following gif of a work-in-progress **Pony VSCode Intellisense** implementation at least 65535 times and cheer in anticipation and gratefulness for the hard work of IRC user patroclos:

The next one is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21, 2018 at 03:30 PM (GMT-05:00) America/New York via zoom. Join the [Dev Mailing List](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev) to get all the details. We'd love to have you there.

## RFCs

### Pending

- [Remove HTTP server from the standard library](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/pull/117).

- [Rename Logger in net/http to HTTPLogger](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/pull/116) in order to avoid name clashes in the standard library.

- [Improved Ponybench](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/pull/119)

- [Class and Actor field Docstrings](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/pull/115) is implemented by [PR 2543](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2543) and is impatiently waiting to be reviewed.
