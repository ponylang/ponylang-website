## Last Weeks Playground

![Celebrate!](https://media.giphy.com/media/nHfltKkjPIC4/giphy.gif)

I hereby celebrate the creation of the weekly Pony `Last Weeks Playground` section. 

You have a wicked [Pony Playground](https://playground.ponylang.io) example that you want to share? Some cool language feature you just found out about and want let people know it exists? Some surprising behavior that you find interesting? Some weird bug, that gives you a headache? Or just something really elegant that wouldn't be possible to express in other languages? 

No matter what, share it! There is no good or bad or simple or advanced. 

### The Rules

* Add some module docstring at the top of your playground link in which the sharable feature of the code below is explained.
* Submit your Playground Link (Use the `Gist` button and share the appearingPlayground link) as a comment to the current [Last Week in Pony Issue](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alast-week-in-pony).
* Take part in the voting Process by adding a `+1` reaction on the comment.
* In case of a tie, I am executing my powers as Last Week in Pony author to decide which one should be featured.
* There can be only one!

### The Link

As I just invented this crazy section, I am taking the freedom to post the first link:

This one is about generic primitives.
