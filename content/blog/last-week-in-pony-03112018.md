## Items of note

* Audio from the [March 7 Pony Development Sync](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/2018_03_07).
* I've been doing some testing on how to improve read performance for `TCPConnection`. In particular, related to how `expect` is implemented. If you are interested, there's a repository available with some basic test code: [https://github.com/wallaroolabs/pony-network-tests](https://github.com/wallaroolabs/pony-network-tests).

## Last Week's Playground

We have one "Last Week's Playground" submission from [MightyAlex200](https://github.com/MightyAlex200).

Alex notes:

> My submission is quite simple, but I hadn't ever seen anything like this in any other language and I thought it was cool that Pony can do this.
>
> This snippet demonstrates adding a method to primtives via trait subtyping that overloads the "not" operator to return a specific primitive.
>
> This allows types to be easily declared as "opposites" of each other
