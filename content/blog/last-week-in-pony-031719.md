## Items of note

- Audio for the March 12, 2019 Pony sync is [here](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2019_03_12.m4a).

- Did you know we have a calendar you can subscribe to for the Pony Development Sync? Well, whether you did or not, it's moving! Previously it was on groups.io. We have a new one that you can subscribe to:
    https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=NTlqY3J1NmY1MG1ycHFibTdlbTRpY2xua2tAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ

    Whenever a sync is cancelled or rescheduled, we'll update the calendar as soon as possible. So, subscribe and perhaps attend a sync from time-to-time.

- There's a conference in Detroit on June 29 that is looking for a speaker from the local area who would give a Pony talk. If that is you, drop Sean a line at sean@monkeysnatchbanana.com and he'll get you in touch with them.
