## Items of note

- Pony 0.28.0 has been released. It's considered a high-priority bug fix upgrade, so upgrading ASAP is recommended. More details are available in the [release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2019/03/0.28.0-released/).

- Audio for the March 19, 2019 Pony sync is [here](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2019_03_19.m4a).

- All recordings of Pony development sync meetings going back to the beginning are available without being behind a "paywall". Check them out at https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/.

- We're leaving Slack for the greener fields of permanent history on Zulip. Zulip is a lot like Slack so the adjustment should be fairly quick. The biggest difference, you have "streams" and "topics" rather than "channels". Learn more at https://zulipchat.com/help/about-streams-and-topics and then join us in the new [Ponylang Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/).

- We've shutdown our mailing lists since the traffic was minimal, especially after opening the Slack and later Zulip. The mailing list have been put into a read-only mode so they can be referenced in the future. If you occasionally used a Pony mailing list, we invite you to join us in our much more active [Zulip community](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/).

- Have a fun problem you tackled with Pony? Show off your solution at the next Pony Virtual Users Group. Let us know if you're interested on [Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189934-general/topic/virtual.20user.20group).

## News and Blog Posts

- We're excited to announce that Josh Horwitz will be speaking at [Detroit Tech Watch](https://detroittechwatch.org/). Join Josh on a tour through Pony, which will allow you to write fast, safe, efficient and highly concurrent programs.

- Andrew Turley updated the [Pony Cheat Sheet](https://www.ponylang.io/media/cheatsheet/pony-cheat-sheet.pdf) to use the ponylang.io domain, include a Zulip link, show how to do doc strings, and fix an error. Go check it out if you haven't already.
