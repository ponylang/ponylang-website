## News And Blog Posts

* Paul did a great first blog post about Pony's reference capability system called *How To Train Your Pony*: [https://paul.lietar.net/2018/03/how-to-train-your-pony-introduction/](https://paul.lietar.net/2018/03/how-to-train-your-pony-introduction/). And it is just the start to an even greater series of posts!
