Episode 12 of the Pony Virtual Users' Group is available.

<!--more-->

## Items of note

- There was no Pony development sync this week as Sean had work commitments and Joe had personal ones.

- [Episode 12 of the Pony Virtual Users' Group is available](https://vimeo.com/695067236). It's 100 minutes of deep dive into a tricky aarch64 runtime bug. We touch on TOCTOU problems, the ABA problem, atomics, and a mess of deep Pony runtime information.

## Issue of the Week

The issue of the week is [ponylang/ponyc #4077](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/4077). It's not an easy one, unless you have the right background knowledge.
