> We would kindly ask everybody to help us with a particular blindspot in our existing test suites for ponyc: interacting with the process environment (reading from stdin, writing to stdout/stderr, environment variables, cli arguments, signal handling ...).

> We set up a github issue to track and discuss ideas: https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3128
