It was a bit of a quiet week in terms of public activity but there's plenty brewing behind the scenes.

## Pony 0.13.2 released

0.13.2 is an incremental bug fix release focused mostly on edges of the type system. As usual, [release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/04/0.13.2-released/) are available on the website for your perusal.

## Items of note

- The Pony core team has started a conversation about no longer creating pre-built Linux binaries for each release. Full details are available in [an email](https://pony.groups.io/g/user/topic/we_re_considering_dropping/4993866?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,4993866) that I sent to the mailing list.
- Audio from the [Pony Development Sync for April 26](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/April%2026,%202017) is available for your listening pleasure. Lots of discussion of various type system implementation edge cases and issues.

## News

- Sylvan Clebsch, creator of Pony, will be giving a [talk](http://www.curry-on.org/2017/sessions/pony-714-days-later.html) at Curry On in Barcelona about how Pony has grown over the last two years. Once again, Curry On is looking like an [amazing conference](http://www.curry-on.org/2017/). If you get a chance, you should attend.
