### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_04_25.m4a) from the April 25th, 2023 sync is available.

<< content >>

If this sort of thing interests you, please feel free to attend a Pony Development Sync. We have it on Zoom specifically because Zoom is the friendliest platform that allows folks without an explicit invitation to join. Every week, [a development sync reminder](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce/topic/Sync.20Reminder) with full information about the sync is posted to the [announce stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce) on the Ponylang Zulip. You can stay up-to-date with the sync schedule by subscribing to the [sync calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/59jcru6f50mrpqbm7em4iclnkk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). We do our best to keep the calendar correctly updated.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
