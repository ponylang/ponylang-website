## Items of Note

* Github User [d-led](https://github.com/d-led) provided an example for [Vaughn Vernons Domain Driven Design with Actors](https://github.com/VaughnVernon/DDDwithActors) in [Pony](https://github.com/d-led/DDDwithActorsPony). This is a quite good comparison between the different actor system languages and libraries out there.
* A new version of [ponycheck](https://github.com/mfelsche/ponycheck), the property-based testing library for Pony, has been released. Version [0.4.0](https://github.com/mfelsche/ponycheck/releases/tag/0.4.0) brings partial Generators and some simplification of the Generator API, for more details, see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/mfelsche/ponycheck/releases/tag/0.4.0).
