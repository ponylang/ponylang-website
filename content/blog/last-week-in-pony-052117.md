## A Call for Help!

- Anyone interested in porting Pony to work on 64-bit ARM? If yes, we could use a maintainer, chime in on [issue #1719](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/1719).

## Items of note

- A new version of [Ponylang-mode](https://github.com/SeanTAllen/ponylang-mode), the Emacs mode for Pony, was released. [Release notes](https://github.com/SeanTAllen/ponylang-mode/releases/tag/0.0.9) are available.
- [Audio from the May 10, 2017, Pony Development Sync](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/May%2017,%202017) is available for your listening pleasure. Lots of type system and some wonderful discussion of the fun that is computers and dates.
- [RFC:34 Bare methods and lambdas](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0034-bare-ffi-lambdas.md) has been [merged to master](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1858). RFC 34 is going to be a great boon to interfacing with some libraries via C-FFI that wasn't previously possible. Want to work with a C library that uses function pointers as callbacks? Awesome, because now we have you covered.
