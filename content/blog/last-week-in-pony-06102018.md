## Pony Releases

Yes, indeed, we have a section for this now. And yes, it is plural. And yes, maybe we release this often to prove we have tighter release cycles than java, now they switched to time-based versioning, because this is what it's all about after all, isn't it?

So, as with every good story, lets start at the beginning:

### Pony 0.22.4 - [Release Notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2018/06/0.22.4-released/)

Two small bugfixes around union types with the same elements and the `cli` package.

### Pony 0.22.5 - [Release Notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2018/06/0.22.5-released/)

High-priority bugfix for systems with NUMA enabled. Upgrading is highly recommended. 

### Pony 0.22.6 - [Release Notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2018/06/0.22.6-released/)

This one fixes a performance regression introduced in the 0.22.X series and fixes a bug in tuple handling that could cause crashes during compilation. Here too, we recommend to upgrade.

### Pony 0.23.0 - [Release Notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2018/06/0.23.0-released/)

Whoa! Minor version increase. Why is that? Breaking change, that's why! Blame [RFC 56](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0056-buffered-reader-line-iso.md). But it is actually mainly a bugfix release for several bugs around tuple handling, `Promise.join(...)` and writing big io-vectors to `File`. Upgrading is recommended.
