## Items of note

- Style Guide! We finally have [an official style guide for the Pony standard library](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/blob/master/STYLE_GUIDE.md). No longer will contributors have to examine the existing code to try and figure out "what is acceptable" formatting. Big props to Theo Butler for driving the style guide to completion *AND* updating the standard library to match. 

- [RFC #21](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0021-custom-serialization.md) "Add support for custom serialisation" [has been merged to master](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1839). Thank you, Andrew Turley, for this awesome addition to Pony. The [motivation section of the RFC](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0021-custom-serialization.md#motivation) contains an overview of how this will be a boon to people working with non-Pony code from within Pony.

- The final portion of [RFC #42](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0042-more-persistent-collections.md) [was merged to master](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1949). The PR adds a persistent vector type to the standard library. Thank you, Theo Butler, for proposing and implementing this latest addition to our persistent data types.

- Audio from the Pony development sync from June 7, 2017, is [now available for your listening pleasure](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2017_06_07.m4a). I'd love to tell you what topics we discussed, but I forgot to write it down. I had a long week, and chances of my remembering without listening are slim. O, and listening, not happening. Whatever we discussed, I'm sure its enthralling (as per usual). Enjoy!
