## Items of Note

### Pony is mentioned in a blog post

Adrian Boyko noted on Zulip that Pony was mentioned in a blog post called ["10 Lesser-Known Programming Languages Worth Exploring"](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/10-lesser-known-programming-languages-worth-exploring-fb2ef988e0d5).

Pony was listed as position 1, followed by Nim, Julia, Elixir, Rust, Haxe, Agda, Idris, Gosu, and Kotlin.

My take, if you are a Pony person and you were going to learn one of those, do Idris. Why? Because I love dependent typing and the creator of Idris is an awesome fellow.

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_06_06.m4a) from the June 6th, 2023 sync is available.

There was no agenda for this week's meeting. We devoted the entire meeting to discussing how to integrate [mutation testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing) "into the Pony compiler". Note this was for mutation testing that can be used by end users on their Pony code, not mutation testing *of* the Pony compiler.

During the call, a couple links were shared, those were:

- [Mull it over: mutation testing based on LLVM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01540)
- [Pitest mutators](https://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators/)

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.
