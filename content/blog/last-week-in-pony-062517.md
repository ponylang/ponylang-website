## Items of note

- Video of Sylvan's [Curry On](http://www.curry-on.org/2017/) talk ["Pony: 714 Days Later"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGDSnOZaU7Y) is now available. The talk is intended to be a followup to [his first Curry On talk about Pony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvLjy8w1G_U). "Pony: 714 Days Later" stands on its own. However, it is interesting to watch both and get a feel for what has changed with Pony over the two intervening years.

- A first version of [RFC #38: "CLI Syntax"](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0038-cli-format.md) has been [merged to master](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1897). This is the first step towards deprecating the `Options` package for command line argument parsing. 

- Audio from the [June 21, 2017 Pony Development Sync](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/June%2021,%202017) is now available. I particularly enjoyed this meeting as it features a conversation with a new member of the community. If you are interested in Pony and are looking for ways to contribute, stop by the sync. We love to help new folks get going with contributing.
