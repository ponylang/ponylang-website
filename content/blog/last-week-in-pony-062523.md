## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_06_20.m4a) from the June 20th, 2023 sync is available.

The sync this week as so short that this summary is almost as long. Seriously, check it out for yourself. It's about 5 minutes.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

This week we are taking a look at the [Pony Playground](https://playground.ponylang.io/)!

The Playground is a publicly available web interface to a stable Pony installation that allows community members to share code snippets usually for testing or demonstration. The interface is kept simply to a basic code editor to write/edit the code, three buttons for **Run**, **ASM**, and **LLVM IR** to interact with the `ponyc` compiler, a **Share** button to generate a permalink, and a dropdown to change editor settings. This resource is perfect if you have a question about Pony as you can paste the minimal example into the Playground then share the link alongside your question in the community Zulip in the [#beginner-help](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189985-beginner-help) stream.
