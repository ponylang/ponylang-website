## Items of note

"Slow week" in terms of items of note. Plenty happening behind the scenes but not a whole lot to point you at this week.

- Audio from the [June 28th Pony development sync](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2017_06_28.m4a) is available for your listening pleasure. I'd love to summarize the meeting for you but I wasn't able to attend and haven't had a chance to listen yet myself. I like surprises, hopefully you do too.

- There a new release coming soon but we are currently waiting to close out a couple of issues. See [https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/1976](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/1976) for more details.
