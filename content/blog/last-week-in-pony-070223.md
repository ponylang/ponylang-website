## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

There was no recorded development sync this past week although Sean, Adrian, Dipin, and Red did chat for a bit.

### July 4th Pony Development Sync Cancelled

Next week's Pony Developmeny Sync would fall on a national holiday in the US. Given the likely very low turnout, we've cancelled the sync.

### No `ponyc` Release This June

Normally we have a monthly release of `ponyc`. However, there's not really any changes worth releasing at this point so, there won't be a June release of `ponyc`. The next release is tenatively scheduled for the end of July assuming that:

- No critical issues are fixed before the end of July
- Something worth releasing is merged is merged before the end of July

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
