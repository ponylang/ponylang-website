Hey all, I wanted to announce that I'm leaving the Pony core team. I've been working with Pony since early 2016 and it's a great language and great community. But my job has shifted away from using Pony, and I've had some events in my life over the last year or so (some good, some less good) that have impacted my ability to commit the time that I think is necessary to being a core team member. I'll still be in zulip, and I'll try to contribute to Pony where I can. I'll always be an evangelist, and if we're every in the same place I'd love to talk to you about refcaps and actors and all the other good stuff. Thank you all for making this a great experience.
