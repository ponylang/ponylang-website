I need one or two people to help with some testing. Requirements to help.

I need someone with an intel mac running big sur and another person with an intel mac running either catalina or mojave.

If you can help, please let me know.

What is going to be involved:

- cloning a test branch of ponyc
- building ponyc from source
- using that ponyc to compile a hello world program and verify that it links without warnings and runs without issues

then finally, the big sur user will make the ponyc they build AND the hello world they built available to the mojave/catalina user who will verify they can use them both without issue.

If you can assist, please stop by the [Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189934-general/topic/MacOS.20testing.20help.20needed) and let me know.
