## Items of note

- Recording of the July 21, 2019 Pony developer sync is available [here](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2019_07_16.m4a).

- Four "new" Pony libraries came into exist this week. Really, they've existed for a while, but they are now "off on their own". The four new libraries are:
    - [crypto](https://github.com/ponylang/crypto)
    - [glob](https://github.com/ponylang/glob)
    - [net-ssl](https://github.com/ponylang/net-ssl)
    - [regex](https://github.com/ponylang/regex)

    Each of the four relies on an external C library for the core of its functionality. As part of a move towards an easier to maintain release process (more on that coming soon!), they've been moved out of the standard library into their own repositories. Version 0.30.0 of Pony which will be released by early August will be the first release that the libraries aren't in. You should expect to see "version 1.0" versions of the four libraries tagged prior to that date.

    If you are interested in more details now, you can check out the Pony development sync from July 9, 2019 for more details.
