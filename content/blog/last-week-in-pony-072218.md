## Items of note

Tutorial with Sylvan Clebsch and Sean T. Allen at Code Mesh LDN 2018:

Writing a chat system in Pony:

- When: 7 November 2018 - 09:00-12:30 GMT

- Where: Code Mesh LDN 2018, Radisson Blu Edwardian Vanderbilt, 68-86 Cromwell Road, London, SW7 5BT

- What: Let's write a chat system in Pony together. The actor model is a natural fit for network programming, so let's use it along with reference capabilities to write an event-driven chat system. By the time we're done, you'll be able to write message-passing based Pony programs, use reference capabilities for performance and correctness, and produce native binaries with C like performance.

This tutorial is currently at the Early Bird rate, which expires on 9 August 2018!
