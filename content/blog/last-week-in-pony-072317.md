## Items of note

- Alpine Linux support [has landed on master](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/1844) and will be released in Pony 0.16.0. Thanks to Dipin Hora for doing the initial work.
- LLVM 4.0 support is [on the way](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2061). Gordon Tisher picked this up and ran with it when no one else had time. When this gets merged, everyone should drop Gordon a note of thanks. I'll do mine now: Thanks Gordon! You rock!
- Supporting a ton of different LLVM versions is difficult for a small team. There's a proposition to remove LLVM 3.7 support once 4.0 support lands. If this would ruin your day, [please let us know](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/2063).
- Audio from the [July 19, 2017 Pony development sync](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/July%2019,%202017) is available for your listening pleasure. 

## News and Blog Posts
  
- While not specifically "Pony", I thought this would be of interest to the Pony community. Back at QCon London this spring, Martin Thompson moderated an awesome panel [What's Next for Our Programming Languages?](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/panel-languages-future?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=calendar). The panel includes amongst others, our very own Sylvan as well Joe Duffy and Brian Goetz. If you listen to the development sync calls, you'll hear Joe's name come up a lot. It's a great panel and worth your time if you are interested in programming languages.
- A few weeks back, I gave a talk on Pony at QCon New York. The video will be released sometime later this summer. In the meantime, if you are interested in seeing it, I have a few invites left that get you access to the "pre-release" video. Want an invite? [Drop me a line](mailto:sean@monkeysnatchbanana.com) with the email address to invite. In the meantime, you can [enjoy the slides](https://speakerdeck.com/seantallen/pony-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-embrace-an-unproven-technology).
