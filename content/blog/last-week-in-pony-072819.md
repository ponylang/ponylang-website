## News and Blog Posts

- Sean T. Allen:

    I will be giving a Pony tutorial at CodeMesh in London this November. Tickets are now on sale. There will be a second teacher as well (perhaps Sylvan again, but no promises are being made). Last year there was a great turn out and excellent reviews. Come experience it for yourself.

    Unlike last year, we will be doing an all-day session so you can get much deeper into learning Pony. Tutorial tickets are available via the [CodeMesh LDN website](https://www.codesync.global/conferences/code-mesh-ldn/tutorial/).

- Sean T. Allen:

    Hi all, I'm looking at setting up an all day "learn you some Pony" workshop some weekend in October in NYC. I would be myself and Jonathan Brown running the workshop, if you are interested in attending, let me know. I'm trying to gauge interest. You can reach me on the [Pony Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/) or via email at [sean@monkeysnatchbanana.com](mailto:sean@monkeysnatchbanana.com)
