## Pony 0.16.0 and 0.16.1

On Friday we released version 0.16.0. There are no critical bug fixes so you can hold off upgrading if you want to. However, please be aware that there is a breaking change in 0.16.0 that will impact just about every Pony codebase there is. It has the potential to be a painful upgrade, so we put together some tools to help update your codebase. See the [release post](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/07/0.16.0-released/) for more details.

At this time this "Last Week in Pony" was published, we were in [the process of releasing 0.16.1](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/2101). It addresses a couple of high priority bugs. We suggest upgrading once it's released.
