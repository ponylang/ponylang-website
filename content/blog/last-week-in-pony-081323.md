## Items of Note

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

This week we are looking at [Pony's Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/ponyc). As with any sizable open source project, Pony has expenses to cover such as hosting for resources like the Pony Playground, Zoom for Pony Sync calls and open office hours, or hardware to test/support more platforms. These expenses and others can all be seen on the Pony Open Collective page. Let's take a brief tour of this resource.

When you first visit the Pony Open Collective page you will see a few tabs of interest, in order: Contribute, Budget, Connect, and About. Contribute will direct you to the various monthly contribution tiers -- at this time $5, $25, and $100/month -- as well as an option for one-time donation. Budget will direct you to a preview of the latest expenses and transactions alongside the current balance and estimated yearly budget. If you want to view all expenses or transactions, one way to do this is to hover over Budget and click either [Transactions](https://opencollective.com/ponyc/transactions) or [Expenses](https://opencollective.com/ponyc/expenses). Both of these pages allow you to filter or search for specific instances or types. On the Expenses page, there is also a short list of commonly applied tags: web services, software, hardware, and communications, clicking any of these will narrow expenses to only those with a particular tag. Back on the main page, Connect and About will both give you information about Pony, news, the team behind the project.

We want to thank all those who contribute to Pony's continued success either with their time or money. It would not be possible for this project to continue without your generous support!
