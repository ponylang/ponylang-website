## News and Blog Posts

- The paper ["43 Years of Actors: A Taxonomy of Actor Models and Their Key Properties"](http://soft.vub.ac.be/Publications/2016/vub-soft-tr-16-11.pdf) looks at actor systems and proposes different ways of categorizing them. The paper is a great overview of what systems exist and their similarities and differences. I'll be thinking about this when I try to explain Pony to folks who are familiar with other actor-based systems. The paper briefly mentions Pony, which is nice.
