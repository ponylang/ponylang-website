## 0.18.0 Released!

Yesterday we released Pony 0.18.0. It includes a high-priority bug fix in the compiler. Upgrading as soon as possible is recommended. Please note amongst the other changes is a small breaking standard library change, so we advise [reading the release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/08/0.18.0-released/) before you proceed.
