- [Flynn](https://github.com/KittyMac/flynn) aims to bring a Pony-like actor-model implementation to Swift. It is powered by a modified version of the [Pony Runtime](https://www.ponylang.io/faq/#runtime) and utilizes a [custom linter](https://github.com/KittyMac/flynn/blob/main/docs/FLYNNLINT.md) to enforce actor-model safety at compile time.

- We will no longer be announcing Pony compiler releases on Twitter.
