## Items of Note

### CirrusCI Migration Update

All done! Everything has been moved off of CirrusCI or ["decommissioned"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVDP5M0eTcM).

### DockerHub to GitHub Container Registry Migration

As we [mentioned last week](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2023/08/last-week-in-pony-august-27-2023/#we-re-migrating-container-images-from-dockerhub-to-github-container-registry), we are migrating from DockerHub to GitHub Container Registry. On December 1st, we'll stop updating images in DockerHub. This past week we updated the following images:

- `ponylang/changelog-bot-action`

We've updated to post future releases while we migrate to both registries. It's unlikely we'll see another release before during the migration period so we uploaded tag 0.3.5 to GitHub Container Registry.

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_08_229.m4a) from the August 29th, 2023 sync is available.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Releases

- [ponylang/release-bot-action 0.6.2](https://github.com/ponylang/release-bot-action/releases/tag/0.6.2

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
