## Items of note

> [Pony Language Server](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-language-server) has been created to implement a Language Server for Pony. This will allow for a rich editing experience when using VSCode (I think other editors and IDEs also have ways to use LSP plugins as well). Think IntelliSense, type info and docs on hover, go to definition, find references, syntax error highlighting, etc. Tools like this are a huge boon to newcomers to the language, and having this could really help with adoption.

> I'll be working on this to start - I have extensive experience with Javascript and Typescript so I am a great fit to start work on the Client side of the project. But I need help with the server side, so please reach out to me (anthony.bullard@gmail.com) or @SeanTAllen if you are interested.

### Approved RFCs

> [RFC #58](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0058-partial-arithmetic.md) aka "Partial Arithmetic" [has been merged to master](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2865) and will be in the next Pony release.
