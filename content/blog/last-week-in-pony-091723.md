## Items of Note

### Update your ponyc for Windows ASAP

We've released an important bug fix for Pony on Windows. You should update to 0.56.2 as soon as possible.

### Office Hours is Moving

Starting Friday October 6th, Office Hours is moving to a 12:30 Eastern start time. The calendar has been updated accordingly. Until then Office Hours will be at it's normal time. It has been moved to accommodate Sean's new work schedule.

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_09_12.m4a) from the September 12th, 2023 sync is available.

This week's sync was a reasonably short affair. We ran through some PRs. Merged two important "want to get these out as soon as possible changes". We also discussed the ongoing permissions lockdown we've been doing around GitHub Actions to harden up our attack surface.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

Office Hours rather short this week. No Pony talk. We went for 15 minutes and learned a bit about Red's RV.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
