We are looking for people to help fix bugs in the Arm version of Pony. And we'll provide you with equipment. We have budget to supply folks with Raspberry Pi 4 systems to use for development and testing. Yes, building LLVM takes "just a little while", but after that, I can report it's "not as slow the last time I tried to use a Pi for Pony development a few years ago".

If you have good knowledge of C and a familiarity with C++ and want to get dirty with the Pony compiler and runtime plus probably some LLVM, we want you! Drop by the [Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to.20Pony) and let us know you are interested.

Just think of it $120 worth of hardware in return for hours and hours and hours of your time plus working with the Pony core team. If that doesn't sound like a no-brainer, I don't know what does. This is more fun than you can shake a stick at, and trust us, we've shaken sticks at heaps and heaps of fun.
