Big news! We have working Arm CI again. And we are very close to having Pony working on Apple's M1 CPUs.

There's still work to do getting Pony fully working on 32-bit and 64-bit OSes on the Raspberry Pi 4B, but we have working CI for 32-bit and 64-bit Arm CPUs.

We'd like to thank all our collective supporters without whose support we wouldn't have been able to purchase the hardware we've used getting this far.

Stop by the Zulip and give everyone involved in getting us this far a bit of thanks.
