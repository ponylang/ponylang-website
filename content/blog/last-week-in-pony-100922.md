Come 'crush a cup of wine', talk shop, and watch us work on implementing this [library](https://github.com/ponylang/postgres).

## Issues of the Week

Each week, we will highlight "good first issues" from the Pony ecosystem that we're trying to motivate someone to spend a bit of time on closing. If we close the issue of the week every week, by the next week, it will really add up and help Pony move forward quicker. So hey, how about you make this week your week?

This week we have issues from both the ponyc and the pony-tutorial repositories:

- ponyc
  - ["Invalid documentation generated"](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/1262)

- pony-tutorial
  - ["Flesh out pattern matching chapter intro"](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-tutorial/issues/75)

Until next week, Pony On!
