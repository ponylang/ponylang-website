## Pony 0.19.3 released

Call this a bug fix release. Lots of bugs fixed. Runtime bugs, compiler bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Ok, maybe not quite that many but, if you [check out the release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/10/0.19.3-released/) you'll find eight. Given there are no breaking API changes in this release, we strongly advise everyone to update as soon as possible.

## Items of note

- Audio from the October 12th, Pony development sync is available for your listening pleasure. I'd love give you a summary but, I had to miss the meeting and haven't had a chance to listen. I bet you beat me to it, especially if you start right now. As always, head over to our [developers' groups.io](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev) and [have a listen](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2017_10_11.m4a).

## RFCs

Interested in making a change, or keeping up with changes to Pony? Check out the [RFC repo](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs). Contributors welcome!

### RFC issues opened
  
Most of the time, an RFC starts its life as a pull request. Sometimes though, we open issues to get more input when we aren't sure enough about something to do an RFC. We expect that RFCs will often change from when they are opened. You can think of issues for RFCS as "hey, let's talk about this". Last week, we had two:

- [Type parameter constraint syntax for safe matches](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/issues/105)
- [Add docstrings for class/actor members](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/issues/106)
