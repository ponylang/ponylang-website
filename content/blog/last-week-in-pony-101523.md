## Items of Note

### Pony 0.57.0

Pony 0.57.0 was released this past week. It fixes a flaw in the implementation of the type system. Versions prior to 0.57.0 allow for unsafe data handling with `recover` blocks. We advise updating as soon as possible.

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_10_10.m4a) from the October 10th, 2023 sync is available.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
