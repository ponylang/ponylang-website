## Pony 0.20.0 released

Pony grew up a bit and we are proud to tell you that release **0.20.0** is out!

With this release we fixed some possible issues with OSX installs. If you have those issues we really recommend upgrading. Also the stdlib experienced a small breaking (but really helpful) change in the `buffered.Writer` class. Read up the details in the [release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/10/0.20.0-released/).


## Pony Stable 0.1.1 released

[Pony-stable](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-stable), the Pony dependency mananger, matured a lot and we celebrate its `0.1.1` release. More details are waiting to be read in the [release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/10/pony-stable-0.1.1-released/). Bugs have been fixed and it is now able to print its own version: `stable version`. How meta!
