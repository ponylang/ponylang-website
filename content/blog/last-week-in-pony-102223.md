## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_10_17.m4a) from the October 17th, 2023 sync is available.

This week's sync was focused on issues and PRs in the ponyc repo. Some of the issues were new, some were old. And then we were on discussing GitHub's support for MacOS on Apple Silicon.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
