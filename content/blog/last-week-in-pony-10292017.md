## News and Blogposts

- Our very Sean T. Allen from Wallaroo Labs published a blog post on why they chose Pony for building Wallaroo: https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2017/10/why-we-used-pony-to-write-wallaroo/ If you don't know if you should consider Pony, this is a great read which will definitely give you more confidence for your decision, whatever it may be. Also make sure to follow the very decent discussions on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/78v16n/why_we_used_pony_to_write_wallaroo/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15558051).

- There has been a talk about *Orca*, the Pony Garbage Collector at SPLASH 2017 in Vancouver: [Orca: GC and Type System Co-Design for Actor Languages](https://2017.splashcon.org/event/splash-2017-oopsla-orca-leveraging-types-and-messaging-for-fully-concurrent-gc). Here is [the original paper](/media/papers/orca_gc_and_type_system_co-design_for_actor_languages.pdf) this talk is based upon.

## Items of note

- Pony now has an [RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)-compliant WebSocket server: https://github.com/oraoto/pony-websocket !

- The Pony development sync audio from last week is available right [here](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/2017_10_25), right now! Amongst other stuff it features Sylvan sharing pretty exciting ideas about the future of the Pony GC and thus the typ system itself.

- George Steed's Thesis "A Principled Design of Capabilities in Pony" is now available in the Papers section of the Pony website as well: https://www.ponylang.io/community/#papers. Last year George did a Virtual Users' Group presentation on his thesis as well: https://vimeo.com/178522513
