## Items of Note

### SSL Builder Updates

It's that time of the year! Our twice a year update of our the SSL builder images we use for testing/building Pony organization projects and that we make available to the you for the same purpose.

Every time around, we add a new builders, stop updating the oldest ones and let you know which ones we are deprecating. Deprecated builders will stop being updated the next time around.

Each image is updated with a new version of the Pony compiler and other tools after each nightly ponyc build and after each ponyc release.

We've added:

- x86-64-unknown-linux-builder-with-libressl-3.7.3

We've deprecated:

- x86-64-unknown-linux-builder-with-libressl-3.7.2

We've stopped updating:

- x86-64-unknown-linux-builder-with-libressl-3.5.3

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

If you'd be interested in attending an Office Hours in the future, you should join some time, there's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
