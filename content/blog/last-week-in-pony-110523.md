## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_10_31.m4a) from the October 31st, 2023 sync is available.

We had a short agenda that we ran through pretty quickly.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every week for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try. The meeting is open to anyone. Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Office Hours calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). Hopefully, we'll see you at an Office Hours soon.

This week we held Office Hours at our new time: 4 PM Eastern on Mondays. We had a better attendence than we did with the previous and short-lived Friday mid-day slot.

There was some discussion of C++ co-routines. A lot about Go's concurrency model. Some about the differences between Erlang and Pony. Most of the conversation flowed from a discussion of how silly we found it that there's a repository on the Internet that trying to compare an Erlang actor model implementation of a toy problem to other concurrency models. In particular, that it attempts to compare performance when in many languages like Go, it's an entirely different program and the toy problem does't even make sense in Go.

We had a good time. You should join us on the 6th.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
