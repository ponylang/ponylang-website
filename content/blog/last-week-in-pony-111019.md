Last week has seen a ton of improvements to our CI and release automation thanks to Sean T. Allen. We have also been working toward making ponyup the default for installing and managing the Pony compiler and tools. Three new members have been inducted into the Pony core team.

## 3 New Core Team Members!

Pony gets 3 new core team members!

We are happy to announce that long-time Pony contributor Theo Butler has accepted our invitation to join the Pony core team. Theo has regularly stepped in to help out and push Pony forward and we look forward to seeing what he does going forward.

Also joining the core team this week is Andrew Turley. Andy has been part of the Pony community for quite some time. Andy might be most famous for putting together the awesome Pony workshop materials that we use to help teach Pony to folks.

And last, but not least, Gordon Tisher is joining the core team. Most folks usually interact with Gordon because he does the vast majority of the maintenance Windows support in Pony. He also is working on getting us a unified build system and does work on updating Pony to support new LLVM version.

Welcome aboard @theodus, @aturley, and @kulibali!
