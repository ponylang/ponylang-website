## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_11_07.m4a) from the November 7th, 2023 sync is available.

We ran through our single item agenda pretty quick, but then there's some discussion after. All of it is about our new "bot" that posts "good first issue" items to Zulip.

We need some assistance with it, please help!

See [https://github.com/ponylang/pony-sync-helper/issues/18](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-sync-helper/issues/18).

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every week for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try. The meeting is open to anyone. Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Office Hours calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). Hopefully, we'll see you at an Office Hours soon.

So here's the deal with this week's Office Hours. I attended. It was fun. We had a blast. I think Dipin, Adrian, and Red were also there. I didn't write up this summary "right away" and now... well, now it's Saturday and I have no idea what we talked about and so...

"This is the summary".

Join us and you won't need a summary!

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
