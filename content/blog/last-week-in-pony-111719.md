## Items of note

- Audio from the November 12, 2019 Pony sync is available [here](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2019_11_12.m4a).

- Version 0.1.0 of corral has been released. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ponylang/corral/releases/tag/0.1.0) for more details.

- [The Pony Playground](https://playground.ponylang.io/) is back. The machine it was hosted on went down very hard a couple of weeks back, but it's back! Thanks to @packethost for the hosting. They rock. Wonderful folks. Just a note, the new server isn't 100% set up so expect us to take it up and down a few times over the next few days. Hopefully, no one notices.
