## Items of note

- [*Generalized Runtime Backpressure*](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/commit/1104a6ccc182d94e3ec25afa4a2d028d6c642cc4) has been merged to master. This is definitely a huge win for the Pony runtime. Watch out for the next Pony release, where we will discuss this topic in greater detail in an accompanying blog post.

- This week the pony devs did meet up in the regular fashion at Wednesday 3:30 PM (GMT-05:00) America/New York. Convince yourself and listen to them by downloading the [recorded audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2017_11_15.m4a).
