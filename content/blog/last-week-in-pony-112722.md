## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2022_11_22.m4a) from the November 22nd, 2022 sync is available.

<<content>>

If you are interested in attending a Pony Development Sync, please do! We have it on Zoom specifically because Zoom is the friendliest platform that allows folks without an explicit invitation to join. Every week, [a development sync reminder](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce/topic/Sync.20Reminder) with full information about the sync is posted to the [announce stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce) on the Ponylang Zulip. You can stay up-to-date with the sync schedule by subscribing to the [sync calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/59jcru6f50mrpqbm7em4iclnkk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). We do our best to keep the calendar correctly updated.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Lately, the meetings have been based around the work on getting a Postgres driver working and the corresponding work on Lori. Other office hours topics have been "open support time" where more experienced community member help others diagnose bugs or otherwise, get unstuck with the Pony projects they are working. And sometimes, it is just a gab fest. And sometimes, no one shows up!

Perhaps we will see you at the next one! Interested in giving attending a go? There's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Releases

## Highlighted Issues

Pony is a volunteer driven project. Nothing gets down without someone volunteering their time and helping to push things forward. Yes, there are folks who dedicate more time than others and a core team that dedicates time specifically for guiding Pony's development. Everyone's time is limited, so each week, we highlight a couple of issues that we hope will inspire someone to volunteer their time to help fix.

In addition to our highlighted issues, you can find more that we are looking for assistance on by visiting just about any [repository in the ponylang org](https://github.com/ponylang/) and looking for issues labeled with "help wanted"

If you are interested in working on either issue or any other issue from a Ponylang repository, you can get in touch on the issue in question or, even better, join us on the [Ponylang Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/) to strike up a conversation.

This week's issues as selected by Ryan A. Hagenson are:

### fu

bar

### zip

zap

## RFCs

Major changes in Pony go through a community driven process where members of the community can write up "requests for change" that detail what they think should be changed and why. RFCs can range from simple to complex. We welcome your participation.

After considerable conversation, the "Introduce Empty Ranges" RFC was accepted this week. There was a great deal of conversation on the RFC PR about improving the APIs for both `Range` and `Reverse` to make them both less error prone. It was finally decided to accept the RFC as is and create an [official request](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/issues/204) for an RFC to improve both `Range` and `Reverse`.

### Official Requests

Requests for RFCs from the Pony core team.

- [Improve Range and Reverse](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/issues/204)

### Accepted RFCs

RFCs that have been accepted and can be now be implemented.

- [Introduce Empty Ranges](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/pull/201)
