## Items of Note

### DockerHub Migration Update

We've stopped pushing new images to DockerHub. There might be a stray image here or there that we missed, but you can consider the migration done.

If you are using any Pony related container images that are coming from DockerHub and they are using a "release" or "latest" tag or other equivalent, update to getting the same image from GitHub Container Registry.

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_12_05.m4a) from the December 5th, 2023 sync is available.

We had a short sync this week. Primarily, we ran through the PRs to finish the DockerHub migration.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every week for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try. The meeting is open to anyone. Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Office Hours calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). Hopefully, we'll see you at an Office Hours soon.

Office Hours was another rambling affair with three mostly brain dead attendees: Adrian, Dipin, and Sean. Some things were discussed including the [E programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(programming_language)) and [APL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_%28programming_language%29).

Interested in background? Check out the [initial conversation](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/234733-off-topic/topic/Algorithm.20Request.3A.20uniform.20and.20100.25.20coverage.20prng) from the Ponylang Zulip.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

When beginning to use Pony you may run into a few common errors that are initially confusing. Thankfully, we have a page on the Pony Tutorial walking through why [some common errors](https://tutorial.ponylang.io/appendices/error-messages) occur and how to fix them. Not all the most common error messages are there -- what is common for one person is not common for another -- so if you face a difficult-to-decipher error message feel to reach out on the [beginner help](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189985-beginner-help) channel on Zulip!
