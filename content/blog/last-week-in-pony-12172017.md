## Items of note

- Wouldn't it be horribly interesting if you could get to know what is currently cooking in and around Pony? Indeed it would! Don't worry! There is the weekly Pony Developer Sync Call every Wednesday at 03:30 PM (GMT-05:00) America/New York via zoom. Here is the [Recorded Audio for last weeks Call](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/2017_12_13).
- We are all very excited about the upcoming Pony release [0.21.0](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/2379#issuecomment-352192398) that is scheduled for next week! 

## News and Blog Posts

- The folks over at Wallaroo Labs have published a [blog post](https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2017/12/dynamic-tracing-a-pony---python-program-with-dtrace/) by Scott Fritchie (also a Pony committer!) about using DTrace to get observability into Wallaroo Python applications. It's got a ton of resources on DTrace and SystemTap. It's also the best resource out there right now for observing Pony programs using DTrace: https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2017/12/dynamic-tracing-a-pony---python-program-with-dtrace/
