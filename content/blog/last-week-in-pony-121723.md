## Items of Note

### Holiday Sync Cancellations

We're canceling our development sync meetings on the 26th of December and the 2nd of January given their proximity to holidays. Our final sync meeting of the year will be Tuesday, December 19th.

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_12_12.m4a) from the December 12th, 2023 sync is available.

We ran through our agenda of items marked as "discuss during sync". There was nothing ground-breaking in the content.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every week for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try. The meeting is open to anyone. Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Office Hours calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). Hopefully, we'll see you at an Office Hours soon.

There was no Office Hours this past week. Sean was ill.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

Occasionally, someone looking at Pony for the first time will be coming from a Rust background and wonder how the two languages compare. Thankfully, we have a few existing resources! One was recorded as part of the Virtual Users Group, where Matthias Wahl gave a talk on [Pony vs Rust: How they both drive you mad at compile time](https://vimeo.com/574893226). Definitely worth a watch!
