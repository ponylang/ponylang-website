## Items of Note

### MacOS on Intel is no longer a fully supported platform

A few weeks back, we [announced that we would be dropping support for MacOS on Intel](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2022/11/last-week-in-pony---november-27-2022/#ending-macos-on-intel-as-a-fully-supported-platform). At the time, we said that we would be doing it "before the end of the year", well, "before the end of the year is here". On December 12th, we merged the changes to drop MacOS on Intel support from ponyc, corral, and ponyup.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every Friday for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try.

Interested in giving attending Office Hours sometime? There's a [calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) to stay up-to-date with the schedule. We do our best to keep the calendar up-to-date.

## Highlighted Issues

Pony is a volunteer driven project. Nothing gets down without someone volunteering their time and helping to push things forward. Yes, there are folks who dedicate more time than others and a core team that dedicates time specifically for guiding Pony's development. Everyone's time is limited, so each week, we highlight a couple of issues that we hope will inspire someone to volunteer their time to help fix.

In addition to our highlighted issues, you can find more that we are looking for assistance on by visiting just about any [repository in the ponylang org](https://github.com/ponylang/) and looking for issues labeled with "help wanted"

If you are interested in working on either issue or any other issue from a Ponylang repository, you can get in touch on the issue in question or, even better, join us on the [Ponylang Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/) to strike up a conversation.

This week's issues as selected by Ryan A. Hagenson are:
