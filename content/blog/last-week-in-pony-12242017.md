## Pony 0.21.0 released

***Merry Christmas everybody!***

We managed to slip the new Release [0.21.0](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.21.0) of Ponyc into your christmas stocking.

This is one of the biggest releases so far, containing tons of bugfixes, some really sweet additions and even some breaking changes. So unwrapping ... errrh ... updating is highly recommended. But the greatest feature of them all in this release is definitely the [Generalised Runtime Backpressure](https://stdlib.ponylang.io/backpressure--index).

The [Release Blog Post](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/12/0.21.0-released/) contains all the gory details.

## Items of note

- [Ponycheck](https://github.com/mfelsche/ponycheck) [0.2.0](https://github.com/mfelsche/ponycheck/releases/tag/0.2.0) has been released. Ponycheck is a library for property based testing for Pony. With this release Ponycheck supports compositional shrinking. If you ask yourself what the heck that means (like me), check out the [Release Notes](https://github.com/mfelsche/ponycheck/releases/tag/0.2.0)

- Another Week, another Pony Development Sync Call. Those calls are public and if you'd like to join and bring up a burning topic, just join the [Dev Mailing List](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev) to get all the details. We'd love to have you on board to discuss your issues and/or ideas. Here is the [Recorded Audio for last weeks Call](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/files/Pony%20Sync/2017_12_20).
