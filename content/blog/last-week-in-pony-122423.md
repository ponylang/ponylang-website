## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2023_12_19.m4a) from the December 19th, 2023 sync is available.

It was a very short sync. We ran through the agenda which was 1 Pull Request and 1 issue.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
