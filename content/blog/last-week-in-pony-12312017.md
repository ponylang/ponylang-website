## Pony 0.21.1 and 0.21.2 released

We got lucky this christmas and have been gifted with two new releases!

[0.21.1](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/12/0.21.1-released/) brought us

* [Dynamic scheduler thread scaling based on workload](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2386) and 
* [Support setting the binary executable name with --bin-name](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/2430). 

This release comes with improved stability and memory consumption of the runtime, so updating is recommended.

[0.21.2](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/12/0.21.2-released/) is a bugfix release for Dynamic Thread Scheduling, and thus it deserves our gratefulness even more.

## Items of note

- Due to the holidays there has been no Pony Development Sync this week. The next one is scheduled for Wednesday, January 3, 2017 at 03:30 PM (GMT-05:00) America/New York via zoom. Join the [Dev Mailing List](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev) to get all the details. We'd love to have you there.

## New RFCs

- There is a new RFC out for [Class and Actor field Docstrings](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs/pull/115).
