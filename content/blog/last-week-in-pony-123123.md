## Items of Note

## Meetings reminder

Reminder, there will be no Pony Development Sync, nor Office Hours this week. We'll see y'all again on the 8th.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.
