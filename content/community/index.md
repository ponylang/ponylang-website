## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic. Our [code of conduct]({{< relref "code-of-conduct.md" >}}) sets the standards for behavior in all official Pony forums.

## Getting Started
