## Chat

If you are interested in having a real time conversation about Pony, check out the Pony [community Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com).

## Zulip Community

Most Pony community interactions happen in our [Zulip community](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com). Zulip is kind of like Slack but, better. Well we think it's better anyway. One of the big differences how Zulip organizes conversations. You can learn more about that in their [Steams and topics documentation](https://zulipchat.com/help/about-streams-and-topics).

Once you join our Zulip, there are a number of streams that you'll be subscribed to by default. Some key streams you might be interested in are:

If you are a Pony user looking for assistance or to  discuss writing Pony code, you'll want to join the [beginner help steam in our Zulip community](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189985-beginner-help).

If you are looking to contribute to Pony, you'll want to join the [contrinute to Pony stream in our Zulip community](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to.20Pony).

If you are interested in finding out when our Virtual Users' Group is meeting or when new videos are posted, you should join [announce stream in our Zulip community](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce/topic/VUG).

## Users' Groups

We currently know of 1 User Group. We also have a Virtual Users' Group which didn't meet in quite some time now. In general, it meets about once a month via [Zoom](https://zoom.us). If you would be interested, join and drop us a line, we would be happy to revive that tradition.
[Videos](https://vimeo.com/search/sort:latest?q=pony-vug) of past presentations are available.

If you'd like to attend an in-person meetup, sign up for the mailing list or join the meetup group to be informed the next time a meeting is occuring:

* [Berlin Users' Group](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Berlin-Ponylang-Meetup/)

## Community Survey

We run a yearly community survey to find out what the Pony community currently looks like. So far, "yearly" means "once". If you are interested in learning a bit more about the community you'll be joining, check out the [2016 State of the Stable]({{< relref "state-of-the-stable-2016.md" >}}) community survey

## Pony Development

If you are interested in helping to develop Pony, we have a [variety of resources]({{< relref "contribute/index.md" >}}) to get you started.
