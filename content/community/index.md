## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic. Our [code of conduct]({{< relref "code-of-conduct.md" >}}) sets the standards for behavior in all official Pony forums.

## Getting Started

The most important community resources for those who are new to Pony are:

* Pony [community Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com)
* The [Users Mailing List](https://pony.groups.io/g/user) for discussion of all things Pony that don't involve the development of Pony itself
* The [frequently asked questions]({{< relref "faq/index.md">}}) section of this website.

If you are looking for help with Pony and can't get a response in Zulip, we advise that you send an email to the Users Mailing List. 

## News

* [News, blog, whatever you want to call it](/blog)

## Mailing Lists

We host all our mailing lists with [groups.io](https://groups.io). You'll need a [groups.io account](https://groups.io/register) to sign up for any of our mailing lists.

If you are a Pony user looking for assistance or to  discuss writing Pony code, you'll want to join the [Users' mailing list](https://pony.groups.io/g/user).

If you are looking to contribute to Pony, you'll want to join the [Developers' mailing list](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev).

If you are interested in finding out when our Virtual Users' Group is meeting or when new videos are posted, you should join the [Virtual Users' Group mailing list](https://pony.groups.io/g/vug).

## Users' Groups

We currently know of 3 User Groups. We also have a [Virtual Users' Group](https://pony.groups.io/g/vug) which didn't meet in quite some time now. In general, it meets about once a month via [Zoom](https://zoom.us). If you would be interested, join and drop us a line, we would be happy to revive that tradition.
[Videos](https://vimeo.com/search/sort:latest?q=pony-vug) of past presentations are available.

If you'd like to attend an in-person meetup, sign up for the mailing list or join the meetup group to be informed the next time a meeting is occuring:

If you are interested in setting up a users' group in your area and would like to host the mailing list on groups.io, drop us a line and we'll get you set up.

## Community Survey

We run a yearly community survey to find out what the Pony community currently looks like. So far, "yearly" means "once". If you are interested in learning a bit more about the community you'll be joining, check out the [2016 State of the Stable]({{< relref "state-of-the-stable-2016.md" >}}) community survey

## Pony Development

If you are interested in helping to develop Pony, we have a [variety of resources]({{< relref "contribute/index.md" >}}) to get you started.
