Ready to learn Pony? Awesome.

## Getting help

Need help? Not to worry, we have you covered.

We have a couple resources designed to help you learn, we suggest starting with the tutorial and from there, moving on to the Pony Patterns book. Additionally, standard library documentation is available online.

* [Tutorial](http://tutorial.ponylang.org).
* [Pony Patterns](http://patterns.ponylang.org) cookbook is in progress
* [Standard library docs](http://ponylang.github.io/ponyc/).

If you are looking for an answer "right now", we suggest you give our IRC channel a try. It's #ponylang on Freenode. If you ask a question, be sure to hang around until you get an answer. If you don't get one, or IRC isn't your thing, we have a friendly mailing list you can try. Whatever your question is, it isn't dumb, and we won't get annoyed.

* [Mailing list](mailto:pony+user@groups.io).
* [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ponylang).

Think you've found a bug? Check your understanding first by writing the mailing list. Once you know it's a bug, open an issue.
