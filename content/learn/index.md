Ready to learn Pony? Awesome.

## Getting started

We have a couple resources designed to help you learn, we suggest starting with the tutorial and from there, moving on to the Pony Patterns book. Additionally, standard library documentation is available online.

* [Tutorial](http://tutorial.ponylang.org).
* [Pony Patterns](http://patterns.ponylang.org) cookbook is in progress
* [Standard library docs](http://stdlib.ponylang.org/).

## Getting help

If you run into trouble while you are learning Pony, don't worry, we've got you covered. You have a couple different options on how you can get help from the Pony community. If you are looking for an answer "right now", we suggest you give our IRC channel a try. It's #ponylang on Freenode. If you ask a question, be sure to hang around until you get an answer. If you don't get one, or IRC isn't your thing, we have a friendly mailing list you can try. Whatever your question is, it isn't dumb, and we won't get annoyed.

* [Mailing list](https://pony.groups.io/g/user).
* [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ponylang).

Think you've found a bug? It's quite possible. Pony is a relatively young language that is still changing at a rapid pace and bugs do happen. Your best bet. Write to the mailing list with your issue and verify that you are experiencing an issue. Once a more knowledge member of the community confirms you are experiencing a bug, open an issue.

The Pony community while small is very helpful and inviting. We think you'll find interacting with us to be an ejoyable experience. You can find a lot more community related resources in the [community section](/community) of this site.
