- [Pony Patterns](https://patterns.ponylang.org/)

> Pony Patterns is a cookbook style collection of patterns for working with Pony. Most folks aren't familiar with writing actor-model based code. Even fewer are familiar with doing it in a typed language that features causal messaging. Wondering how to do something? Check out the patterns and see if there's one that solves your problem. Patterns is a curated community-driven project. Feel free to open an issue requesting a pattern on how to do X, or open a PR to contribute your own pattern.
