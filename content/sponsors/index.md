## Services Sponsors
The following companies kindly donate resources to Pony. We are incredibly grateful for their support. We love using their services and think you would as well.

### 1Password

[1Password](https://1password.com) hosts our shared secrets for free as part of their [open source support](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source). It solves quite a few problems for us.

### Appveyor

[Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) runs our continuous integration tests on Windows. They support a ton of open source projects. Wonderful service.

### CircleCI

[CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) runs our continuous integration tests on Linux. It lets us test our code on manifold configurations and architectures. They support several open source projects. Amazing solution.

### Groups.io

[Groups.io](https://groups.io/) hosts our mailing lists. They have some additional "forum-like" features including calendars and file hosting. We take advantage of both for hosting the recordings of our weekly development sync. If you are looking for a replacement for Google Groups, check them out.

### JFrog

[JFrog](https://www.jfrog.com/) hosts our release artifacts on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/). They are some of the nicest people we've ever dealt with. We initially set up our bintray in a way that was using way too much space. They worked with us to solve the problem **AND** set us up with a free [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/) account as well.

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosts our website. They are an amazing service for hosting static websites. We take advantage of some [their features](https://www.netlify.com/features/). After using Netlify, we're not sure we'd ever want to use anything else.

### Travis CI

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) runs our continuous integration tests on both Linux and MacOS. They support a ton of open source projects. Great project.
