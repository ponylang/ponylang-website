The following companies kindly donate resources to Pony. We are incredibly grateful for their support. We love using their services and think you would as well.

## Appveyor

[Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) runs our continuous integration tests on Windows. They support a ton of open source projects. Wonderful service.

## Groups.io

[Groups.io](https://groups.io/) hosts our mailing lists. They have some additional "forum-like" features including calendars and file hosting. We take advantage of both for hosting the recordings of our weekly development sync. If you are looking for a replacement for Google Groups, check them out.

## JFrog

[JFrog](https://www.jfrog.com/) hosts our release artifacts on [Bintray](https://bintray.com/). They are some of the nicest people we've ever dealt with. We initially set up our bintray in a way that was using way too much space. They worked with us to solve the problem **AND** set us up with a free [Artifactory](https://www.jfrog.com/artifactory/) account as well.

## Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosts our website. They are an amazing service for hosting static websites. We take advantage of some [their features](https://www.netlify.com/features/). After using Netlify, we're not sure we'd ever want to use anything else.

## Travis CI

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) runs our continuous integration tests on both Linux and MacOS. They support a ton of open source projects. Great project.

## Whitequark

[Whitequark](https://whitequark.org/) is kind enough to host the logs of our #ponylang freenode channel. He provides logging services for a number of channels. Pretty awesome if you ask us.
