## Services Sponsors

The following companies kindly donate resources to Pony. We are incredibly grateful for their support. We love using their services and think you would as well.

### 1Password

[1Password](https://1password.com) hosts our shared secrets for free as part of their [open source support](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source). It solves quite a few problems for us.

### Cirrus CI

[Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/) provide us with free services to run our FreeBSD and MacOS CI jobs, like they do to all open source projects. Simply brilliant.

### Cloudsmith

[Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/) is providing free hosting for our nightly builds. That's incredibly awesome and they are great folks.

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) provides a ton of free services to open source projects such as ours. Running the project without the services that GitHub provides for free would be very difficult.

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosts our website. They are an amazing service for hosting static websites. We take advantage of some [their features](https://www.netlify.com/features/). After using Netlify, we're not sure we'd ever want to use anything else.

### Zulip

[Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) powers and hosts [our team chat service](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/), thanks to their [open-source hosting plan](https://zulipchat.com/for/open-source/). We're very happy with it!
