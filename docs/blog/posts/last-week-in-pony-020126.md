There's a new Pony available. It has a number of bug fixes and ships with a vastly improved language server. We suggest you upgrade soon.

<!-- more -->

## Pony 0.60.5

Pony 0.60.5 has been released. 0.60.5 is the first release that ships with the Pony  language server.

In addition to now being packaged with `ponyc`, the language server has gotten a number of enhancements thanks to Orien Madgwick. The release also has a number of `ponyc` fixes from Red Davies.

The [release notes](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.60.5) contain a full accounting of all the changes.

## Sync is moving

We've moved sync from Tuesdays to Wednesday. The new time is 3 PM Eastern. The calendar has been updated accordingly. See you this Wednesday!

## New Contributor

Orien Madgwick has been granted contributor status in the Ponylang GitHub organization. It's a step towards becoming a committer and having access to commit code to the ponylang repositories.

Orien has been doing great work enhancing the language server. You should definitely give it a try. It's a lot better than it was before Orien arrived. And hey, if you see him on Zulip, be sure to thank him for his hard work.
