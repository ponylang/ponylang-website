Be wary of nightly Ponyc builds. They may be broken. The Pony team is working on it. In the meantime, stick with the latest release.

## Items of Note

### Broken Nightly Builds

On Friday, we merged a PR that makes improvements to the cycle detector. Unfortunately, that isn't quite what happened. Instead, we have stress tests failing. I wouldn't trust any nightlies until we get this sorted out. Keep an eye on [this Zulip thread](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/189934-general/topic/Avoid.20ponyc.20nightly) for updates.

### Pony Development Sync

The recording from this week's Development Sync is now [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/1053546199).

I didn't jot down any notes about what was discussed, but I'm sure it was a great conversation. I mean, I was there so I should remember but, yada yada yada: you should check it out!

### Office Hours

We had a nice sized crowd at Office Hours this week. Red and I discussed the [Lori](https://github.com/ponylang/lori) based HTTP server that Red is playing around with and then a new attendee Steve Leak showed up with a number of excellent "can you explain questions".

If you are learning Pony, Office Hours is a great place to get assistance.

Attendees were: Red, Steve Leak, Adrian, Alex Webber, Nathan Watts, and myself.
