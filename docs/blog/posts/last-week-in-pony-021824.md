It was a fairly slow week in Pony. There was no Office Hours; the Development Sync was relatively short; but, we do have a "new website". And, the "Constrained Types" RFC was implemented and merged into the Pony standard library.

## Items of Note

### "Updated" Pony website

This weekend, Sean moved the Pony website to MkDocs. For several years, it was using a customized Hugo theme that stopped working ages ago unless you used a very old version of Hugo.

While waiting for the Super Bowl to start, he spent a few hours moving the site over to using MkDocs and the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) "theme".

Everything should be working as it was before, but it is possible some links got broken or other functionality might have gotten broken in the move. If you find anything, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang-website/issues/new).

### Contributors Repository Archived

The [contributors repository](https://github.com/ponylang/contributors) that contained information relevant to Pony contributors and committers has been archived.

All of the content has been merged into the [Pony website](https://www.ponylang.io/) and is now available in the [contribute section](https://www.ponylang.io/contribute/).

### Pony Development Sync

[Audio](https://vimeo.com/917353039) from the February 13th, 2024 sync is available.

We had a quick agenda this week. It was about 15 minutes total. Have a listen.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every week for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try. The meeting is open to anyone. Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Office Hours calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). Hopefully, we'll see you at an Office Hours soon.

There was no Office Hours this week. Sean has incapacitated with a migraine.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

If you have ever wondered how and why Pony came about -- including where the name came from -- there is [An Early History of Pony](/blog/posts/early-history-of-pony.md) blog entry written by the designer of Pony himself, Sylvan Clebsch.
