### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every week for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try. The meeting is open to anyone. Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Office Hours calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). Hopefully, we'll see you at an Office Hours soon.

There was no Office Hours this week. Sean has incapacitated with a migraine.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

If you have ever wondered how and why Pony came about -- including where the name came from -- there is [An Early History of Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/05/an-early-history-of-pony/) blog entry written by the designer of Pony himself, Sylvan Clebsch.
