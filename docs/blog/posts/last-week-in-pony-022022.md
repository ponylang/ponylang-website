## Items of note

- Audio from the February 15th, 2022 Pony development sync is now available: [https://vimeo.com/916937017](https://vimeo.com/916937017). We covered a lot of ground including ponyc bugs [#3737](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3737), [#2150](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/2150), and [#3997](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3997). If you listen along you might also learn a bit about how the Pony compiler handles field initialization checks for try/else, if/else, and other control structures.

## Issue of the Week

This week's issue is [adding a remove command to ponyup](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup/issues/66). There is little prerequisite knowledge required to take this on, though experience using ponyup would definitely be beneficial. Feel free to ask any questions related to this in the tooling stream in Zulip.
