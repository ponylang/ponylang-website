## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

The [recording](https://vimeo.com/917355285) of the February 27th, 2024 sync is available.

### Office Hours

This week's Office Hours was in many ways, a recap of last week's. Adrian Boyko took Red Davies through the particulars of the "leasable buffer" that was [discussed last week](/blog/posts/last-week-in-pony-022524.md#office-hours).

Additionally, Adrian shared [a link](https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/2017-01-05-buffers/) to a very cool data structure from the [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) project emulates a ring buffer.

While Red and Adrian were talking, I was working on getting [a pull request](https://github.com/manuzhang/mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin/pull/75) in shape to fix a bug in [mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin](https://github.com/manuzhang/mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin) that was causing us to not be able to proof all our URLs in the Pony website. That pull request was a follow-on to [another pull request](https://github.com/manuzhang/mkdocs-htmlproofer-plugin/pull/72) that I opened last week.
