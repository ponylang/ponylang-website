- There's a new version of the [Pony playground available](https://playground.ponylang.io/). Go give it a spin and see if you can notice the new features. Thanks @mfelsche for your work!

## Issue of the Week

This week's issue is [Add back the ability to compile without `-pic` to the CMake build system](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3467) on the ponyc repo. This should be a fairly easy enhancement to the build system. Experience using CMake would be helpful.

## RFCs
