## Items of Note

### Update changelog-bot-action Immediately

A bizarre bug prevents [ponylang/changelog-bot-action](https://github.com/ponylang/changelog-bot-action) from working. Update to version 0.3.7 immediately.

### Update release-notes-bot-action Immediately

A bizarre bug prevents [ponylang/release-notes-bot-action](https://github.com/ponylang/release-notes-bot-action) from working. Update to version 0.3.10 immediately.

### Ponyc Release Coming

We closed a race condition in the runtime at the end of the week. A new release will be out soon to address this. Expect 0.58.13 shortly.

### Office Hours

Office Hours featured live debugging of cycle detector related "memory explosion" issues with Sean and Dipin leading the charge. Red, Adrian, and Nate also attended.

Dipin demonstrated his in-progress tracing for the Pony runtime. It looks great. Later in the week he opened a [pull request](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/4649) for it.
