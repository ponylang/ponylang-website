A new ponyc was released. It fixes a race condition in the runtime. Update soon.

## Items of Note

### Ponyc 0.58.13 Released

We closed a race condition in the runtime. The bug is unlikely to occur, but you should upgrade as soon as possible.

### Office Hours

I attended Office Hours this week. No notes. Can't remember a thing. Totally spaced. I'm sure we all had a blast.
