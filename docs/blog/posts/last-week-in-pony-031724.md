It was another fairly quiet week in Pony. Once again, all our normal committers are quite busy with their day jobs. We did manage to get a new release of `ponylang/http_server` out the door. It would be nice to have more to report next week. Perhaps you can assist by taking a look at the "good first issues" in the [contribute to Pony stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to-Pony) and grab one to work on. Most take very little time to do.
