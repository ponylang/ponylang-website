## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

There was no sync meeting this week. Joe and I both had work commitments.

### Office Hours

There was no Office Hours this week that I am aware of. I got a migraine just a few minutes before it was supposed to start and had to cancel. I'm sorry for the late notice.

Hopefully there was still an awesome get together.
