If anything happened related to Pony this past week, your friendly narrator didn't notice it. I'm sure there was something. I just didn't see it. I'm sorry. I'll do better next week. I promise.

*wink*.

## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

There was no sync meeting this week. Joe and I both had work commitments.

### Office Hours

There was no Office Hours this week that I am aware of. I got a migraine just a few minutes before it was supposed to start and had to cancel. I'm sorry for the late notice.

Hopefully there was still an awesome get together.
