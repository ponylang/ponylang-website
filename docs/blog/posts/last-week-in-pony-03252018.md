## News And Blog Posts

* Paul did a great first blog post about Pony's reference capability system called *How To Train Your Pony*: [https://paul.lietar.net/2018/03/how-to-train-your-pony-introduction/](https://paul.lietar.net/2018/03/how-to-train-your-pony-introduction/). And it is just the start to an even greater series of posts!

## Last Week's Playground

This week we got a great contribution by GitHub user [EpicEric](https://github.com/EpicEric) showing us how Lambdas work in Pony (and it also has a reverse polish notation calculator !!1!11):

[Last Weeks Playground - March 25, 2018](https://playground.ponylang.io/?gist=8674fa3cc3d012a280701ae863fd625f)

In case you want to submit one (which I highly recommend), just add it as a comment to the current [Last Week in Pony Issue](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alast-week-in-pony) and let people vote with `+1` reactions. The one with the most votes is presented (Or i just present them all. Depends on my Sunday evening mood).

## Pony Development Sync
