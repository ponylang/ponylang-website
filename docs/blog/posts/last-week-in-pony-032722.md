The March 22nd Pony development sync recording is available, along with video since there was a good amount of screen sharing during the meeting.

<!-- more -->

## Items of note

- The first 30 minutes of the Pony development sync on March 22nd was a fairly normal affair as the [full audio will show](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2022_03_22.m4a). Around the 30 minute mark, a group debugging of an issue open by Red Davies ensued along with lots of "this will make for great radio jokes". Because there was a good amount of screen sharing, we've also made the [video available](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2022_03_22.mp4) for those who want to get a feel for this particular ponyc compiler bug debugging session. Be forewarned, its a 431 meg download.

## Issue of the Week

This week's issue is [Incorrect information in the `ponysuspendthreshold` help string](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3987) on the ponyc repo. This involves fixing an inaccurate help string for a Pony runtime option.
