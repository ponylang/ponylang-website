## News And Blog Posts

* There is a brand new blog post from the folks at [WallarooLabs](http://www.wallaroolabs.com/) about how their Python API works with Pony: [https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2018/04/the-snake-and-the-horse-how-wallaroos-python-api-works-with-pony/](https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2018/04/the-snake-and-the-horse-how-wallaroos-python-api-works-with-pony/)
* A new package for *Linear Algebra in Pony* by GitHub user @dougmacdoug has been released: [linal](https://github.com/dougmacdoug/ponylang-linal) ([The original Announcement](https://pony.groups.io/g/user/topic/linal_linear_algebra/16887194?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,16887194)).
* Due to [GitHub removing anonymous gist creation](https://blog.github.com/2018-02-18-deprecation-notice-removing-anonymous-gist-creation/) it was not possible to create gists on the [Pony Playground](https://playground.ponylang.io/) for some days. But Paul stepped in and fixed that. Thank you!

## Last Week's Playground

This Playground link showcases a tool to execute your pony source code directly on linux systems using binfmt_misc or a shebang:

[Last Weeks Playground - April 08, 2018](https://playground.ponylang.io/?gist=4e93446ff4dc4283e98b0a08db1a78ae)

In case you want to submit one (which I highly recommend), just add it as a comment to the current [Last Week in Pony Issue](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alast-week-in-pony) and let people vote with `+1` reactions. The one with the most votes is presented (Or i just present them all. Depends on my Sunday evening mood).

The Pony developers met on their weekly sync call on Wednesday April 04, 2018. Check out the [recorded audio](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2018_04_04.m4a).
