We return after a long absence with some very sad news.

<!--more-->

## A sad goodbye

It's with great sadness that we have to report that Carl Quinn has passed away from COVID-19. Carl was a valued member of the Pony community. We'll miss you Carl.

If you've ever listened to the recordings of the Pony sync or interacted with our forthcoming dependency manager, Corral then you've had at least a little contact with Carl. Carl was a kind and thoughtful man. We'll miss his technical contributions and our random chats about things outside of technology.

## Other items of note

- Version 0.3.1 of corral has been released.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/ponylang/corral/releases/tag/0.3.1) for more details.

- The new CMake build system for ponyc has been merged.

Requirements for building from source have changed; please see [BUILD.md](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/blob/main/BUILD.md) for updated details.

- The [Pony development sync recording for April 14, 2020 is now available](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2020_04_14.m4a).

We deviated from our normal format and spent 75 minutes discussing object capabilities in Pony and what we are hoping to get from them. The conversation also touched heavily on C-FFI integration.  Listeners should expect to hear more on the topic in the future. The core team is going to think for a bit on the conversation we had and then get together to draft a document for our goals with object capabilities. We can then use that document as a basis for examining how Pony's current implementation falls short of providing those goals and work on drafting RFCs to improve the situation.
