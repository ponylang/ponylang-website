We hope to update our supported LLVM version soon.

<!-- more -->

## Items of Note

### LLVM 17

A [pull request](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/4680) has been opened to update the version of LLVM used by the Pony compiler to LLVM 17.

### Pony Development Sync

The [recording](https://vimeo.com/1076039176) of the April 15th, 2025 sync is available.

### Office Hours

Office Hours this past week was myself plus Nate, Adrian, and Red. We spent the entire time going through reference capabilities with Nate, answering questions and hopefully helping him get more comfortable with them.

Struggling with anything Pony related? Come on by Office Hours and we will try to help. It's what the meeting is designed for!
