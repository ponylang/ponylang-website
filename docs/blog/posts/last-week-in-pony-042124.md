## Items of Note

### New SSL Builders

We've added new SSL builders that can be used for building SSL dependent Pony applications. `release` and `latest` versions are available for each. The `release` version contains the most recent ponyc release. The `latest` version is contains the most recent ponyc nightly version.

- [LibreSSL 3.9.1](https://github.com/ponylang/shared-docker/tree/main/x86-64-unknown-linux-builder-with-libressl-3.9.1)
- [OpenSSL 3.3.0](https://github.com/ponylang/shared-docker/tree/main/x86-64-unknown-linux-builder-with-openssl_3.3.0)

### SSL Builders Deprecated

We've deprecated 3 SSL builders. Effectively immediately, they will no longer be updated.

- LibreSSL 3.7.2
- OpenSSL 1.1.1t
- OpenSSL 3.1.0

### Pony Development Sync

### Office Hours

As far as I know, there was no office hours this week. I had a migraine and didn't attend.
