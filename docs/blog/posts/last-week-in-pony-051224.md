I was away for the week, so I don't really know what was going on. I'm sure there was something. I'll be back next week with a more informative post.

## Items of Note

### The Sync Recordings Migration is Complete

A while back, we finished moving all our [Pony Development Sync recordings](https://vimeo.com/channels/ponydevelopmentsync) to Vimeo. This past weekend, we finished the final step in the process. We shut down the old sub-domain that we were hosting them on. If you are used to accessing them at [https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/), that won't work anymore.

### Pony Development Sync

The [recording](https://vimeo.com/944032888) of the May 7, 2024 sync is available.

### Office Hours

I'm not sure if there was an Office Hours this week. I spent the week at a work "on-site" and was unable to attend. I'll be back next week.
