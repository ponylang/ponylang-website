## Items of Note

### The Sync Recordings Migration is Complete

A while back, we finished moving all our [Pony Development Sync recordings](https://vimeo.com/channels/ponydevelopmentsync) to Vimeo. This past weekend, we finished the final step in the process. We shut down the old sub-domain that we were hosting them on. If you are used to accessing them at https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/, that won't work anymore.

### Pony Development Sync

The [recording](https://vimeo.com/<<content>>) of the May 6, 2024 sync is available.

### Office Hours

I'm not sure if there was an Office Hours this week. I spent the week at a work "on-site" and was unable to attend. I'll be back next week.
