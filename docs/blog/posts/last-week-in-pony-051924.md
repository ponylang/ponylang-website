Hey, we could use your assistance; assuming you want to get dirty with the Pony compiler.

## Items of Note

### We're Looking for You

The Pony Core team is looking for someone who wants to start working with the Pony compiler to take the lead in fixing a serious [runtime bug](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/4507).

If that is you, drop us a line [in the Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to-Pony).

### Pony Development Sync

The [recording](https://vimeo.com/948011212) of the May 14, 2024 sync is available.

### Office Hours

Adrian and Sean chatted for a while. It was good fun. Not a ton of Pony about it. Perhaps stop by some time.
