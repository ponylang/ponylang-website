Time to update your copy of ponyup! Pony 0.60.0 is coming later this week with significant work on Arm64 binaries for Linux and Windows.

<!-- more -->

## Items of Note

### Ponyup 0.8.6 Release

A couple nights ago, the search API for Cloudsmith changed. The result was that ponyup was no longer able to search by version for packages. This meant that trying to install a specific version of a tool with ponyup would fail.

This has been fixed in ponyup 0.8.6, which is now available. You can update ponyup with:

```bash
 ponyup update ponyup release
```

### Pony 0.60.0 Release

The Pony 0.60.0 release is coming later this week.

### Pony Development Sync

The [recording](https://vimeo.com/1088160618) of the May 27th, 2025 sync is available.

### Office Hours

It was a holiday week in the US so I didn't attend Office Hours. I'm not sure if anyone else did.
