We released a new version of the Pony compiler this past week. It's not a big release, so upgrade at your leisure.

<!-- more -->

## Items of Note

### Pony 0.58.5 Released

We've released Pony 0.58.5. The only change that we felt was significant enough to make it into the CHANGELOG was a change in the images we use as the basis for our Docker images. Or put another way, we don't think there is any reason for you to rush out and upgrade. That said, we did improve some compiler error messages and whatnot so, it's not like there are no improvements-- just nothing earth-shattering.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.58.5) for more details.

### A New Logging Library

Strangejune announced on the Zulip:

> My first project! I made a logging library for Pony, using an actor to implement the interface and traits to allow formatting and logging backends. The repo is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/junetried/pony-logging). I haven't actually used it yet in another project but it seems to work great in every way I've been able to test.

The announcement is [here](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/190363-projects/topic/A.20logging.20library).

### Pony Development Sync

Due to a bit of a miscommunication, we didn't have a sync meeting this week. We are planning on having one this coming week. Expect a lot of conversations around the various pull requests that Sebastian HÃ¤drich has been working on. If you aren't aware, Sebastian has been working on adding the ability to run Pony snippets from the Pony Tutorial in the Pony Playground. It's pretty cool.

### Office Hours

As far as I know, Office Hours didn't happen this week. I took a nice long 3-day weekend and didn't attend. I might not make it to this week's as I have a new team member starting on the 3rd and could be wrapped up with that. If I don't make it, I hope you all have a great time without me.
