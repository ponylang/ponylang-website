## Pony 0.22.3 - [Release Notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2018/05/0.22.3-released/)

Once the release train is a-rollin', ain't nobody gonna stop it!

This time we have two small bug fixes and a lot of improvement on our new release process. Thus upgrading is recommended.

Thanks Dipin Hora, for taking care of this!
