## Items of note

- Pony 0.28.1 has been released! Check out the [release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2019/06/0.28.1-released/) to learn more.

- Recording of the June 4, 2019 Pony developer sync is available [here](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2019_06_04.m4a). A lot of time was spent talking about various language design points. PLT geeks will enjoy this meeting more than our usual ones.

- The Zulip community has surpassed the 200 member mark.

- Earlier this week, GitHub introduced a new feature ["Generate new repositories with repository templates"](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/). This is wonderful news who are using the Pony [library project starter](https://github.com/ponylang/library-project-starter) which will now be easier to use. Give it try!

- We could use some assistance from someone who knows their way around LLVM to get Pony compiling with LLVM 8: [ponylang/ponyc#3034](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/3034)
