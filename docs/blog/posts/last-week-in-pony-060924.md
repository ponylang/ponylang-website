We had an interesting "Pony 1.0" conversation this past week during the sync call.

<!-- more -->

## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

We spent the 2nd half of the meeting discussing what it would mean and what would be "required" for us to consider doing a version 1.0 release of Pony.

The recording is [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/953763146).

### Office Hours

I wasn't able to attend Office Hours this week so I'm not sure what happened.
