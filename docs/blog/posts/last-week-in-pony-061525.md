Work towards the Pony 0.60.0 release has slowed a bit, but we're still working towards it.

<!-- more -->

## Items of Note

### Pony 0.60.0 Release

Much the same as last week, we're working towards the Pony 0.60.0 release. I had hoped to have it out this past week, but that didn't happen. You can follow along with our checklist of pre and post release tasks on the [release issue](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/4690).

At the moment, we're stuck on a ponyup for Windows for arm64 issue that will hopefully be resolved soon.

### Pony Development Sync

The [recording](https://vimeo.com/1092294360) of the June 10th, 2025 sync is available.

### Office Hours

I had a last minute work conflict and was unable to attend Office Hours this past week. I apologize for that. I'm planning to be back tomorrow, June 16th, but I might have another work conflict.
