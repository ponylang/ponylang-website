We have some nice improvements to the website FAQ and corral documentation. RFC 67 has been approved and implemented!
<!-- more -->

## Items of note

- The recording of the July 14, 2020 Pony Development Sync is now available: [https://vimeo.com/916248860](https://vimeo.com/916248860)

- Ryan Hagenson has added a new FAQ to the website on [when Pony programs terminate](https://www.ponylang.io/faq/runtime/#program-exit). It's a question that comes up semi-regularly on the [Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#). Thanks Ryan for adding the FAQ.

- "Adeel" aka @adeel41 recently tried to get started with [corral](https://github.com/ponylang/corral) the in-development Pony dependency manager. He ran into some trouble. He then stepped up and added a bunch of excellent getting started documentation and made it rock by working with Ryan Hagenson and Sean T. Allen. You rock Adeel. Thank you. May all your Ponying be fruitful.
