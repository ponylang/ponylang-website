This week's Last Week in Pony is a two-fer. I was away on vacation so there was no post last week. This week's post covers the last two weeks.

## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

The recording of the July 23th development sync is [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/991181964).

And a quick note, we've moved the start time for the development sync meeting back by half an hour. If you are subscribed to the calendar, you should already be seeing the time change.

### Office Hours

The July 15 Office Hours was a great one. There was a ton of discussion amongst the primary participants: Adrian, Joe, and myself as well as the occasional comment Red who was mostly lurking.

We discussed:

- Petri Nets, Behavior Oriented Concurrency and Verona, and Pony
- "Shareable writable buffers"
- Joe's "ref prime" idea
- Fat pointers and unions and boxing
- and much much more.

I was on vacation on July 22nd, so I don't know if there was a meeting.
