## Items of note

- Audio from the August 3rd, 2021 Pony development sync is available:
[https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2021_08_03.m4a](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2021_08_03.m4a)

- Andreas Stührk, aka @trundle,  has donated his templating library to the ponylang organization. We plan on using it in a variety of ponylang organization projects starting with a new Pony based version of the [release notes reminder action](https://github.com/ponylang/release-notes-reminder-bot-action).
If you aren't familiar with Andreas' library, you can find it at [ponylang/pony-templates](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-templates).
Andreas remains a contributor to the library and we look forward to pushing it forward with him.
Expect to see some housekeeping work on it in the near future including:

    - a license update to BSD-2 clause
    - a repository rename from pony-templates to templates
    - lots more
