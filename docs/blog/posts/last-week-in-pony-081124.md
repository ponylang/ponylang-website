Pretty quiet week in Pony-land.

## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

The recording of the August 6th development sync is [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/997416148).

And a quick note, we've moved the start time for the development sync meeting back by half an hour. If you are subscribed to the calendar, you should already be seeing the time change.

### Office Hours

I will ill on Monday and I'm not sure if Office Hours was held.
