## 0.18.0 Released!

Yesterday we released Pony 0.18.0. It includes a high-priority bug fix in the compiler. Upgrading as soon as possible is recommended. Please note amongst the other changes is a small breaking standard library change, so we advise [reading the release notes](https://www.ponylang.io/blog/2017/08/0.18.0-released/) before you proceed.

## Items of note

- Audio from the [August 16, 2017, Pony development sync](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2017_08_16.m4a) is available. Includes some interesting conversations including a live "wtf is up with [issue #1513](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/1513)"; the result of which was our 0.18.0 release.
