After an unexpected week off, we're back with a double issue of Last Week in Pony. I had Covid that lasted through last Sunday and didn't feel like writing.

## Items of Note

### Office Hours

There were two Office Hours these past two weeks. They bookended my illness nicely. The first was August 18th; the second was August 25th.

On August 18th, Red and I discussed his talk at the [Carolina Code Conference](https://blog.carolina.codes/). We focused on the questions he found interesting during and after his talk. Curious to learn more? Grab Red [on the Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com) and start chatting.

On August 25th, Red, Niclas, and I talked about concurrency. Red was preparing for a job interview. The job involves finding concurrency bugs in code. Niclas and I helped him work through what he would say and otherwise prepped him.

Red has learned a lot about concurrency over the years while learning Pony. Niclas and I have both worked with concurrency in different ways. It was a fun session. I think Red is well prepared for his interview. Good luck, Red!
