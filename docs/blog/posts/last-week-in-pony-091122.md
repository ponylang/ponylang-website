## Items of note

One of your author's projects involves a substantial amount of pulling data from various network devices and pony has been exceptional at the task.  A task that would typically take days to execute using a common Open Source tooling can be performed in ten or so minutes our Pony implementation. Pony moved the bottleneck to the network, where it should be.

However, the challenge is then how to get that data into a database for the rest of the business processes to be able to analyze.  A look around found that there was a lack of a Pony driver for PostgreSQL, the database we used due to its excellent ipaddr and cidr data-type support.

After a weekend or two your Author has written a Proof of Concept [Pure Pony driver for PostgreSQL](https://github.com/redvers/pony-pg). Given the importance of such a driver and after some discussion we have decided that the Ponylang Team will take my PoC and rewrite it as an Official Ponylang Project.

Starting in a few weeks Sean Allen and myself will be working together during [Office Hours](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189934-general/topic/Office.20hours) to complete this task. I'm excited to have my Pony knocked into a more standard shape :)

## Issues of the Week

Each week, we will highlight "good first issues" from the Pony ecosystem that we're trying to motivate someone to spend a bit of time on closing. If we close the issue of the week every week, by the next week, it will really add up and help Pony move forward quicker. So hey, how about you make this week your week?

This week we have issues from both the ponyc and the pony-tutorial repositories:

- pony-tutorial
  - ["Making usage of `this` more apparent"](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-tutorial/issues/458)
  - ["Remove "person" from the Type Aliases description"](https://github.com/ponylang/pony-tutorial/issues/446)

- ponyc
  - ["cli.Arg silently ignores type casting errors"](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/3244)
  - ["Improve type mismatch error message by providing hints when the solution might be guessable from the compiler"](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/issues/2083)

Until next week, Pony On!
