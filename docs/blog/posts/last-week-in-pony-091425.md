Hello, Pony enthusiasts! Time for another weekly update on the Pony programming language. Things have been quiet this week â€“ maybe everyone's taking a break before diving into fall projects, or working on things behind the scenes. Either way, let's keep the tradition going. Even quiet weeks have their place in our community. So grab your favorite drink and let's see what's been happening.

## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

The recording of the September 9th Development Sync is available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/1117290070).

### Upcoming Schedule Change

There will be no Development Sync on Tuesday, September 23rd. Joe and I are both away for a work event. I also won't be at Office Hours on the 22nd. And just to rub it in, there will be no Last Week in Pony next week either. I'll be back the week after that.

### Office Hours

We had our weekly Office Hours session, but no specific items to report this week.
