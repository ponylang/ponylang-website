There's a class using Pony and more...

## Items of Note

### Pony in the Classroom

Apparently, [there's a class out there using Pony](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189985-beginner-help/topic/COP5615). Call us excited! It definitely isn't something we were expecting.

### A Pony Parser in Pony

Gordon Tisher has been working on a parser for Pony, and associated tools, written in Pony itself: [chalcolith/eohippus](https://github.com/chalcolith/eohippus).

The project is at a very early stage, but is now complete enough to demonstrate some workflows.  It contains a mostly complete PEG parser (with left-recursion support) for Pony files, AST classes, some rudimentary analysis, linting support, a formatter app, and a very basic language server.

### Pony Development Sync

The recording of the September 10th development sync is [available on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/1009356099).

### Office Hours

There was no Office Hours. We tried but Adrian couldn't get his audio working and no one else but he and myself showed up.
