## Items of note

Domain change coming! Hi all, for a while now, we've been trying to get the ponylang.org domain transferred from the original registrar over to a new one where all the members of the current core team are able to access and maintain it. Sadly, that has turned into a bit of a mess and doesn't look like it's going to happen. We've been trying to get it worked out for several months now but with no luck. Starting this week, we are going to be migrating as much as we can from ponylang.org to ponylang.io.

As part of that migration, we'll be redirecting as much as we can so that going to [https://www.ponylang.org](https://www.ponylang.org) will get you redirected to [https://www.ponylang.io](https://www.ponylang.io). The plan is to do the same with tutorial.ponylang.org and patterns.ponylang.org.

There might be some bumps along the way and sometimes, the redirect might be kind of primitive. Please bear with us through the switch and if you get any weird errors, please email sean.allen@ponylang.io and let him know the problem. Thanks!

Please check [https://pony.groups.io/g/user/topic/25782868#1763](https://pony.groups.io/g/user/topic/25782868#1763) for updates.
