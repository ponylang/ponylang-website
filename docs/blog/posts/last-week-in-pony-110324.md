## Items of Note

### Developer Voices Podcast

A couple weeks back, I recorded an episode of the [Developer Voices](https://pod.link/developer-voices/) podcast with Kris Jenkins. Over the course of an hour or so, we covered a variety of Pony related topics.

You can check out the episode on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9da3UzEhEI) or on a [variety of other podcast platforms](https://pod.link/developer-voices/episode/89440d0d3be17217212d113cf6a31400).

### Office Hours

I hung out for 15 minutes until someone (Red) arrived. We chatted for a few then decided that no one else was going to arrive so we ended early.
