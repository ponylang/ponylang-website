Pony was the topic of a recent episode of Mike Shah's "First Impressions" series.

## Items of Note

### "First Impressions" Video

Adrian Boyko let me know that a fellow named Mike Shah did a [video about his first hour exploring Pony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA9I6KiCIFA). It starts from "I was told about Pony" and him doing some Googling and ends up with him part way into the tutorial.

Both myself and Sylvan watched the video and loved it. It was great to see someone new to Pony working through the website and the tutorial and getting a feel for the language. It's always interesting to see what people find confusing or difficult when they're new to Pony.

I liked it enough to log into YouTube so I could leave a comment for Mike letting him know how much I loved it.

A few quotes from Sylvan:

> "I hope this guy is a professor somewhere. I think he'd be a legit good teacher."
>
> "I really like that he appreciates the docs."
>
> "I give that a '0% hot take' rating. This guy is great."

There's a few bit of documentation that I wrote that are full of my own special form of jackassery. I'm really happy that Mike got a kick out of the [bureaucracy package documentation](https://stdlib.ponylang.io/bureaucracy--index/).

You aren't going to learn any Pony from this video, but if you are into programming languages, I think you'll like it.

### Office Hours

Office Hours this week was some combination of myself, Adrian, and Red. We talked about a variety of topics, few of which were Pony related. We had a good time. You should stop by and join us some time. We are happy to help with Pony questions or just shoot the shit.
