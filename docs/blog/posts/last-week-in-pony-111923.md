Quiet week in Pony. Calm before the storm, or end-of-year festivities keeping everyone busy?

<!-- more -->

## Items of Note

### Pony Development Sync

There was no sync this week. It was only Joe and Red on the call so they took the time to talk about various things rather than conduct a "real sync" complete with recording.

### Office Hours

We have an open Zoom meeting every week for the community to get together and well, do whatever they want. In theory, Sean T. Allen "owns" the meeting and will often set an agenda. Anyone is welcome to show up and participate. Got a Pony related problem you need help solving and prefer to do it synchronously? Give Office Hours a try. The meeting is open to anyone. Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Office Hours calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4465e68ae24131ae00461a40893f2637a2c9ac510e311a44ff78680e2f183ce3%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). Hopefully, we'll see you at an Office Hours soon.

There were no office hours this week.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

The latest addition to Pony's community resources is the bot that posts a digest of "good first issues" to the [contribute to Pony](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to-Pony) channel in Zulip. In Zulip, many channels -- including contribute to Pony -- are publicly readable. There is no need to sign up in order to see the [digest](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to-Pony/topic/Good.20first.20issues.20as.20of.202023-11-13) from this past week.
