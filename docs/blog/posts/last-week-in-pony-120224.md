There's a new Pony release out. We recommend you update as soon as possible.

<!-- more -->

## Items of Note

### Pony 0.58.7 released

This week, we are thankful for Dipin Hora and the mess of Pony runtime improvement PRs he opened recently. Most of them got releases as part of Pony 0.58.7. It includes a couple of important but non-critical bug fixes. We recommend you update as soon as possible.

Check out [the release notes](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/releases/tag/0.58.7) to learn more.

### Another "interview" might be on the way

Last week, Sylvan and I did an "interview" with Mike Shah. It was a lot of fun. We talked about Pony, programming languages in general, and a bunch of other stuff. It was recorded and we'll let you know here when it comes out.

### Pony Development Sync

The recording of the November 26, 2024 Pony development sync is available. Check it out on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/1033680462).

### Office Hours

Office Hours this past week was myself, Adrian, and Red. A good chunk of conversation revolved around the ["Add support for pinning actors to a dedicated scheduler thread" pull request](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyc/pull/4547) that Dipin Hora opened.

I talked through a number of runtime related issues and what the PR does. Adrian and Red asked a lot of questions and as a result, I discussed with Dipin and he made some changes to the documentation and method names to help make the intent and caveats clearer.

Adrian and Red were both very excited to see the work and are hopefully to be using it soon.

We also discussed how Wayland and Pony actors might work together and how to call Pony behavior from callbacks in C code.

If you are interested in learning more about Pony, I strongly suggest you start attending Office Hours. You'll learn a lot.

## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is getting ready to start up again. If you're doing it using Pony, please feel free to stop by the [beginner help Zulip stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/189985-beginner-help) to get help.

A few members of the Pony community regularly do Advent of Code every year. If they start a special stream to discuss their solutions, we'll let you know in next week's Last Week in Pony.
