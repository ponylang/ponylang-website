We have quite a lot of exciting announcements this week. Releases for Ponyup and Corral are hot off the presses, we have a new committer, and more!
<!-- more -->

## Items of note

- Just a reminder, Pony is an all-volunteer project. We'd like to thank everyone who has contributed this year. You know who you are and what you've done. Thank you to each and every one of you.

- We are happy to announce that the Pony organization has a new member with commit privileges. Ryan A. Hagenson has repeatedly impressed the core team with his thoughtfulness as he has worked to improve documentation. Welcome, @rhagenson!

- Audio from the December 17, 2019 Pony sync is available [here](https://sync-recordings.ponylang.io/r/2019_12_17.m4a).

- Version 0.3.1 of ponyup has been released. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ponylang/ponyup/releases/tag/0.3.1) for more details.

- Version 0.3.0 of corral has been released. See the [release notes](https://github.com/ponylang/corral/releases/tag/0.3.0) for more details.

## News and Blog Posts

- On Wednesday January 8th, Pony core team member Sean T. Allen will be presenting Sylvan Clebsch paper ["Deny Capabilities for Safe, Fast Actors"](https://www.ponylang.io/media/papers/fast-cheap.pdf) at Papers We Love NYC. [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love/events/267124284/) to confirm your spot.

- The most well-known Pony project is [Wallaroo](https://github.com/wallaroolabs/wallaroo); a high-performance distributed stream processing framework written in Pony. AdExchanger recently published a [short case study](https://adexchanger.com/platforms/pubmatic-slashes-infrastructure-costs-with-wallaroo-labs/) about work that Wallaroo Labs did building a data processing system for Pubmatic based on Wallaroo. If you are looking to get a Pony project off the ground at work, the Pubmatic study could make for a nice pairing with the [Why we used Pony to write Wallaroo](https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2017/10/why-we-used-pony-to-write-wallaroo/) blog post that Wallaroo Labs published a couple of years ago.
