## Items of Note

## Meetings reminder

Reminder, there will be no Pony Development Sync, nor Office Hours this week. We'll see y'all again on the 8th.

## Community Resource Highlight

We like to take a moment in each Last Week in Pony to highlight a community resource. There are many community resources that can go unappreciated until _just the right time_ when someone hops into the Ponylang Zulip asking a question or facing a problem we have all had at one time or another. Well here in Last Week in Pony, we make it **just the right time** to highlight one of our excellent community resources.

As we enter a new year, why not make it a resolution to try Pony? The central place for learning Pony is the [Pony Tutorial](https://tutorial.ponylang.io/). It is recommended to start by reading through the Tutorial as it walks you through installing Pony then tours you through how Pony works. Once you complete the Tutorial, try your hand at solving a few problems relevant to your area of work. As you work through your first problems, it might be helpful to keep the [Pony Cheatsheet](https://www.ponylang.io/media/cheatsheet/pony-cheat-sheet.pdf) close by as a reference. If you learn like many, you may want to try "`printf()` debugging" which Pony's capabilities system can make difficult which is why we have a [debug](https://stdlib.ponylang.io/debug--index/) package which gives you the ability to inject print statements to STDOUT and/or STDERR as you work through problems.
