# Development Sync

We hold a weekly meeting of Pony committers to review RFCs, pull requests and issues. Not a committer? Not a problem! The meeting is open to anyone. Feel free to drop by and lurk. Beware though, we might try to pull you into conversation anyway.

Stay up-to-date with the schedule by [subscribing to the Development Sync calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/59jcru6f50mrpqbm7em4iclnkk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).

Each meeting is recorded and all recordings are available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/channels/ponydevelopmentsync). Recordings are available dating back to 2016.

You can check out conversation related to the weekly meetings in the [sync stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/190591-sync) in the [Pony Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/).
