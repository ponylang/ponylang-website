# Pony Development Sync

The Pony Development Sync is a weekly meeting where contributors review open issues and pull requests across Pony projects. It's open to anyone.

The meeting is short, usually around 30 minutes. An agenda is generated automatically from issues and PRs tagged with "discuss during sync" and posted to the [#sync](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/190591-sync) channel on Zulip before each meeting.
