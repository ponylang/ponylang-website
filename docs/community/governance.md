# Governance

Pony is an open source project with a small group of dedicated maintainers. Here's how the project is organized.

## Team Structure

The project has three tiers of involvement:

- **Contributors** can triage issues, manage labels, and help organize work across all Pony repositories.
- **Committers** can merge pull requests and manage branches. Most day-to-day maintenance is done by committers.
- **Core team** members have full administrative access and make final decisions on project direction.

Anyone can contribute code, report bugs, or participate in discussions. The roles above reflect levels of trust and responsibility within the GitHub organization.

## Decision-Making

Significant changes to the language, standard library, or project processes go through the [RFC process](https://github.com/ponylang/rfcs). An RFC is a written proposal that the community can review and discuss before a decision is made.

Day-to-day decisions about issues and pull requests happen at the weekly [Development Sync](/contribute/sync.md), which is open to anyone.

## Financial Support

Pony accepts donations through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/ponyc). Funds are used for infrastructure costs like hosting and tooling.

## Code of Conduct

The project has a [code of conduct and social rules](norms.md) that apply to all community spaces. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact the project team at coc@ponylang.io.
