# Community

The Pony community is small, global, and helpful. Most of us found Pony because we care about writing correct concurrent software without giving up performance. We stick around because the people are good.

This section is organized into three groups.

**Connect** covers how to reach the community and how we operate. [Zulip](zulip.md) is where most conversation happens. Our [community norms](norms.md) describe the behavior we expect. [Governance](governance.md) explains how the project is organized.

**Events** covers recurring community gatherings. [Office Hours](office-hours.md) is a weekly open Zoom call for anyone to drop in with questions or conversation. The [Virtual Users' Group](virtual-users-group.md) hosts presentations on Pony topics.

**Stay Informed** covers ways to follow what's happening. [News](news.md) collects all the channels where we post updates. [Planet Pony](planet-pony.md) is a curated list of talks, articles, and interviews about Pony from across the web.
