# Office Hours

Office Hours is a weekly open Zoom call for the Pony community. Sean T. Allen runs it, but anyone is welcome to show up.

What happens varies from week to week. Sometimes there's a set agenda. Sometimes it's freeform discussion. People bring Pony problems they're working through, ask questions about the language or runtime, or just hang out. If you're new to Pony and want to talk through something synchronously, this is a good place to do it.
