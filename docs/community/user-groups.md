# Users' Groups

We currently know of 1 User Group. We also have a Virtual Users' Group which hasn't meet in quite some time now. In general, it meets about once a month via [Zoom](https://zoom.us). If you would be interested, join and drop us a line, we would be happy to revive that tradition.
[Videos](https://vimeo.com/search/sort:latest?q=pony-vug) of past presentations are available.

If you'd like to attend an in-person meetup, sign up for the mailing list or join the meetup group to be informed the next time a meeting is occurring:
