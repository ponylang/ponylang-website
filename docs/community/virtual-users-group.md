# Virtual Users' Group

The Pony community is spread across the world. There aren't enough people in any one city to sustain a local meetup, so we run a virtual users' group instead.

VUG meetings feature presentations on Pony-related topics, followed by discussion. Talks have covered everything from the runtime's backpressure system to using Pony for game development. Anyone can attend.

## Participating

Join the [#virtual users' group](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/426066-virtual-users'-group) stream on Zulip. We use that stream to coordinate meetings and discuss topics.

To keep up with meeting times, subscribe to the [VUG calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/042ceam97bfg4eseqt3sagq1rk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics).

## Giving a Talk

Have something you'd like to present? Post in the [#virtual users' group](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/426066-virtual-users'-group) stream on Zulip. Talks don't need to be polished or formal. If you've built something with Pony, solved an interesting problem, or explored a corner of the language, that's a talk.

## Recordings
