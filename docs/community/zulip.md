# Zulip

Most Pony community interaction happens on our [Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/). If you've used Slack or Discord, Zulip will feel familiar, but there's one big difference: every message belongs to a **topic** within a stream. Topics work like subject lines on email. They keep conversations organized so you can follow a discussion without wading through unrelated chatter. You can read more in Zulip's [streams and topics documentation](https://zulipchat.com/help/about-streams-and-topics).

## Key Streams

When you join, you'll be subscribed to several streams by default. Here are the ones most relevant to community members:

- **[#announce](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189932-announce)** -- releases, event reminders, and other project-wide announcements.
- **[#general](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189934-general)** -- open-ended discussion about Pony. If you're not sure where something goes, start here.
- **[#beginner help](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189985-beginner-help)** -- questions about learning and writing Pony. No question is too basic.
- **[#virtual users' group](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/426066-virtual-users'-group)** -- coordination for VUG meetings and talk proposals.
- **[#contribute to Pony](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/192795-contribute-to.20Pony)** -- if you're interested in contributing to the project.

There are also contributor-oriented streams for specific areas like the compiler, runtime, and CI. See [Contributor Zulip Streams](/contribute/zulip-streams.md) for the full list.

## Tips

- **Use topics.** When starting a new conversation, create a new topic rather than posting in an existing one. Descriptive topic names make it easy for others to find the discussion later.
- **Format code.** Wrap inline code in backticks and use fenced code blocks (triple backticks) for multi-line snippets. You can add `pony` after the opening backticks for syntax highlighting.
- **Introduce yourself.** When you first join, say hello in the [#new members](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189935-new-members) stream. Tell us what brought you to Pony.
