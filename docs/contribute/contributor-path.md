# Contributor Path

The Pony project has three tiers of involvement: Contributor, Committer, and Core team. Each comes with more access and more responsibility. Invitations to each tier come from existing core team members after internal discussion. There's no application process. We notice when someone is doing good work and extend an invitation.

For the formal structure, see [Governance](../community/governance.md).

## Contributor

Contributors have [triage-level](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) access to all Pony repositories. That means you can manage labels, close issues, and help organize work, but you can't merge pull requests.

This is the easiest tier to reach. If you're actively helping with triage, documentation, or other organizational work, you're a candidate.

## Committer

Committers have [maintainer-level](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) access. They can merge pull requests and manage branches across all projects. Most day-to-day maintenance is done by committers.

The bar is higher here. Commit access requires a track record of good judgment and familiarity with the project's standards. It takes longer to earn than contributor access.

## Core

Core team members have [owner-level](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) access. They make final decisions on project direction and handle administrative tasks.

## Suggested Progression

There's no single path, but a common one looks like this:

1. **Documentation.** Fix typos, improve explanations, fill gaps. It's a great way to learn the codebase and the project's standards. See [Project Documentation](project-documentation.md).
2. **Good first issues.** Pick up well-defined issues that don't require deep domain knowledge. See [Good First Issues](good-first-issues.md).
3. **Triage.** Help organize incoming issues: reproduce bugs, request information, find duplicates. See [Triaging Issues](triage.md). Active triagers are strong candidates for contributor access.
4. **Regular contributions.** Sustained, high-quality work across the project is what leads to committer access.
