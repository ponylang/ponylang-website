# Contribute

Interested in helping develop Pony? Awesome. We could use the help. Here's a list of projects that are currently underway that you can assist with. If none of them interest you, drop a note to the [Zulip community](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com) and we should be able to find something that suits your interests.

Not sure where to start?

If you are new to Pony or don't have a ton of time to devote to helping, we suggest you check out Project Documentation and help to improve our docs. Contributing to documentation is a great way to start learning Pony. Teaching a subject is an incredible way to learn the subject.

If you are new to Pony and have more time to devote, check out the [Good First Issues](good-first-issues.md). Tackle stuff from that and if we run out, switch over to helping with documentation.

If you are a bit more experienced with Pony then it might be time to get involved with triaging incoming issues. Not only will triaging help move the project forward but it's a common first step towards becoming a Pony committer.

This section of the website also contains *a lot* of information that is useful to regular contributors to Pony including those with commit and administrative rights.
