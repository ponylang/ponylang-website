# Contribute

Pony is a volunteer project and we welcome contributions from everyone. There are many ways to help, from writing documentation to triaging issues to contributing code. All contributors are expected to follow our [community norms](/community/norms.md).

**Getting Started** is the on-ramp for newcomers. [Good First Issues](good-first-issues.md) lists well-defined tasks that don't require deep domain knowledge. [Project Documentation](project-documentation.md) is a great way to learn the codebase while helping. [Triaging Issues](triage.md) is a valuable way to help move things forward. The [Contributor Path](contributor-path.md) describes how involvement grows over time.

**Workflow** covers how work gets done. [Submitting Pull Requests](pull-requests.md) explains the fork-and-branch workflow and PR conventions. [Issue and PR Labels](labels.md) describes how we classify work. The [RFC Process](rfcs.md) is how significant language and standard library changes are proposed. [Releases](releases.md) covers how releases happen.

**Project Operations** is for committers and core team members who keep the project running. It covers [CI](ci.md), [infrastructure](infrastructure.md), the [Development Sync](sync.md), and [Last Week in Pony](lwip.md).

**Resources** collects reference material. [Contributor Zulip Channels](zulip-channels.md) lists the channels where project work is coordinated. [Developer Resources](developer-resources/arm-development-with-rpi-4.md) has guides for specific development setups.
