# Last Week In Pony

"Last Week in Pony", or LWIP, is a weekly synopsis of the previous week's Pony news. It's generally released every Sunday. Instructions for creating the LWIP blog post are in [HOW_TO.md in the website repo](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang-website/blob/main/HOW_TO.md). Adding a message to the post simply requires adding a comment to the [issue for the next LWIP entry](https://github.com/ponylang/ponylang-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Alast-week-in-pony).
