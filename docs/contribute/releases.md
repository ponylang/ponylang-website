# Releases

Unto every project must come releases. Without a release, what even is a project? Nothing!

Snark aside, there are a number of projects under the ponylang umbrella including ponyc, corral, ponyup, and several libraries. All ponylang project have an automated release process. You can learn about how to do a release for any given project by reading the "RELEASE_PROCESS.md" document in the root of the projects repository.
