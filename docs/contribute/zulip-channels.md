The [ponylang Zulip](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/) is the primary hub for asynchronous chat within the Pony community. If you are interested in contributing to Pony, you are strongly encouraged to join. When you do join, be sure to introduce yourself in the [#new members](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189935-new-members) channel.
