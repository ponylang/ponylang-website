## Does Pony have a package manager? {:id="package-manager"}

That would be yes and no. Package manager means different things to different people. What we have is a simple dependency manager called [corral](https://github.com/ponylang/corral) that we are working on growing into a full featured tool. Whether that is a more full featured "dependency manager" or more full featured "package manager" depends on how you define the two terms.

## Is there SSL support? {:id="ssl"}

Yes! There used to be SSL support in the Pony standard library, but it's been moved out [into its own library](https://github.com/ponylang/net-ssl).
