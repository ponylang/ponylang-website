# FAQ

We don't answer every question in our FAQs. We probably don't answer the question you have right now, but we do answer the questions that come up often in our [beginner help stream](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/189985-beginner-help). It makes it easy for us to point people to the answer.

If your question isn't answered here, check out our [getting help guide](https://www.ponylang.io/learn/getting-help/).
