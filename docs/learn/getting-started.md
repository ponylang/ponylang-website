# Getting started

We have a couple resources designed to help you learn, we suggest starting with the tutorial and from there, moving on to the Pony Patterns book. Additionally, standard library documentation is available online. The cheat sheet is meant to serve as a quick reference for the main ideas that you'll encounter as you begin to learn Pony.
