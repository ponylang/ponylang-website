# Learn Pony

New to Pony? Start with [installing Pony](installing-pony.md) and then work
through the [tutorial](https://tutorial.ponylang.io). The tutorial covers
the language from the ground up and is the best way to get a feel for how
Pony works.

Once you're comfortable with the basics, the [Pony Patterns](https://patterns.ponylang.io)
cookbook and [standard library documentation](https://stdlib.ponylang.io) are
good next steps. The [cheat sheet](/media/cheatsheet/pony-cheat-sheet.pdf)
is handy to keep nearby as a quick reference.

[Reference capabilities](reference-capabilities.md) are the concept most
people struggle with. We have a page dedicated to resources that will help
you get over that hump.

If you get stuck, don't worry. The Pony community is small but helpful.
Check out [getting help](getting-help.md) for how to reach us.
