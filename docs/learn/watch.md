Videos are a great way to get a feel for Pony. Here are some we recommend.

## [Pony: High-Performance, Memory-Safe Actors (Developer Voices)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9da3UzEhEI)

Sean Allen explains what Pony is, why reference capabilities exist, and how the garbage collector works. Good first video if you want to understand the "why" behind Pony.

## [VUG #11: Pony via a GitHub REST API](https://vimeo.com/592434464)

Sean walks through a real Pony library in progress. Good for seeing what actual Pony code looks like.

## [Learn Pony with Brian and Sean, Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODelwNLePRA)

Sean teaches Brian Pony from scratch. Watch someone ask the questions you'll have.
