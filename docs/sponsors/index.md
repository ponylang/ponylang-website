# Sponsors

Running an open source project takes time and money. Pony is an all-volunteer project where time is whatever folks have. Even with those contributions, there's additional demands on a project.

We need to run CI, store releases somewhere, manage secrets, host websites, and more. Some of these needs are covered by our services sponsors who provide free service to Open Source projects like Pony. Other needs require us to pay money monthly. We collect donations from backers to pay our ongoing expenses.

## Services Sponsors

The following companies kindly donate resources to Pony. We are incredibly grateful for their support. We love using their services and think you would as well.

### 1Password

[1Password](https://1password.com) hosts our shared secrets for free as part of their [open source support](https://github.com/1Password/1password-teams-open-source). It solves quite a few problems for us.

### Cloudsmith

[Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.io/) is providing free hosting for our nightly builds. That's incredibly awesome and they are great folks.

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) provides a ton of free services to open source projects such as ours. Running the project without the services that GitHub provides for free would be very difficult.

### Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) hosts our website.

### Zulip

[Zulip](https://zulipchat.com/) powers and hosts [our team chat service](https://ponylang.zulipchat.com/), thanks to their [open-source hosting plan](https://zulipchat.com/for/open-source/). We're very happy with it!
