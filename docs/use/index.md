# Use

The Use section collects practical information for developing with Pony. It's organized into four groups.

**Development Environment** covers tools for setting up and managing your project: dependency management with corral, the Pony language server for editor integration, linting with pony-lint, and documentation generation with ponyc's built-in doc support.

**Development** covers writing, testing, debugging, and optimizing Pony code. You'll find guides on unit testing and property-based testing with the standard library, step debugging with LLDB, memory tracking, tracing, and performance tuning.

**Ecosystem** lists official packages maintained by the Pony developers.

**Build and Release Tools** covers Docker images, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD tooling maintained by the Pony developers for building and releasing Pony projects.
